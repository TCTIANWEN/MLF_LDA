sighs  but all so soon as the allcheering sun  should in the furthest east begin to draw  the shady curtains from auroras bed  away from the light steals home my heavy son  and private in his chamber pens himself  shuts up his windows locks far daylight out  and makes himself an artificial night  black and portentous must this humour prove  unless good counsel may the cause remove  my noble uncle

with you  she is the fairies midwife and she comes  in shape no bigger than an agatestone  on the forefinger of an alderman  drawn with a team of little atomies  athwart mens noses as they lie asleep  her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs  the cover of the wings of grasshoppers  the traces of the smallest spiders web  the collars of the moonshines watery beams  her whip of crickets bone the lash of film  her wagoner a small greycoated gnat  not so big as a round little worm  prickd from the lazy finger of a maid  her chariot is an empty hazelnut  made by the joiner squirrel or old grub  time out o mind the fairies coachmakers  and in this state she gallops night by night  through lovers brains and then they dream of love  oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight  oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees  oer ladies  lips who straight on kisses dream  which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues  because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are  sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose  and then dreams he of smelling out a suit  and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail  tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep  then dreams he of another benefice  sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck  and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats  of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades  of healths fivefathom deep and then anon  drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes  and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two  and sleeps again this is that very mab  that plats the manes of horses in the night  and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs  which once untangled much misfortune bodes  this is the hag when maids lie on their backs  that presses them and learns them first to bear  making them women of good carriage  this is she  peace peace mercutio peace  thou talkst of nothing  true i talk of dreams  which are the children of an idle brain  begot of nothing but vain fantasy  which is as thin of substance as the air  and more inconstant than the wind who wooes  even now the frozen bosom of the north  and being angerd puffs away from thence  turning his face to the dewdropping south  this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves  supper is done and we shall come too late  i fear too early for my mind misgives  some consequence yet hanging in the stars  shall bitterly begin his fearful date  with this nights revels and expire

thievish ways or bid me lurk  where serpents are chain me with roaring bears  or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse  oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones  with reeky shanks and yellow chapless

impeach and purge  myself condemned and myself excused  then say at once what thou dost know in this  i will be brief for my short date of breath  is not so long as is a tedious tale  romeo there dead was husband to that juliet  and she there dead that romeos faithful wife  i married them and their stoln marriageday  was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death  banishd the newmade bridegroom from the city  for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined  you to remove that siege of grief from her  betrothd and would have married her perforce  to county paris then comes she to me  and with wild looks bid me devise some mean  to rid her from this second marriage  or in my cell there would she kill herself  then gave i her so tutord by my art  a sleeping potion which so took effect  as i intended for it wrought on her  the form of death meantime i writ to romeo  that he should hither come as this dire night  to help to take her from her borrowd grave  being the time the potions force should cease  but he which bore my letter friar john  was stayd by accident and yesternight  returnd my letter back then all alone  at the prefixed hour of her waking  came i to take her from her kindreds vault  meaning to keep her closely at my cell  till i conveniently could send to romeo  but when i came some minute ere the time  of her awaking here untimely lay  the noble paris and true romeo dead  she wakes and i entreated her come forth  and bear this work of heaven with patience  but then a noise did scare me from the tomb  and she too desperate would not go with me  but as it seems did violence on herself  all this i know and to the marriage  her nurse is privy and if aught in this  miscarried by my fault let my old life  be sacrificed some hour before his time  unto the rigour of severest law  we still have known thee for a holy man  wheres romeos man what can he say in this  i brought my master news of juliets death  and then in post he came from mantua  to this same place to this same monument  this letter he early bid me give his father  and threatened me with death going in the vault  i departed not and left him there  give me the letter i will look on it  where is the countys page that raised the watch  sirrah what made your master in this place  he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave  and bid me stand aloof and so i did  anon comes one with light to ope the tomb  and by and by my master drew on him  and then i ran away to call the watch  this letter doth make good the friars words  their course of love the tidings of her death  and here he writes that he did buy a poison  of a poor pothecary and therewithal  came to this vault to die and lie with juliet  where be these enemies capulet montague  see what a scourge is laid upon your hate  that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love  and i for winking at your discords too  have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd  o brother montague give me thy hand  this is my daughters jointure for no more  can i demand  but i can give thee more  for i will raise her statue in pure gold  that while verona by that name is known  there shall no figure at such rate be set  as that of true and faithful juliet  as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie  poor sacrifices of our enmity  a glooming peace this morning with it brings  the sun for sorrow will not show his head  go hence to have more talk of

thoughts of great value worthy cogitations  tell me good brutus can you see your face  no cassius for the eye sees not itself  but by reflection by some other things  tis just  and it is very much lamented brutus  that you have no such mirrors as will turn  your hidden worthiness into your eye  that you might see your shadow i have heard  where many of the best respect in rome  except immortal caesar speaking of brutus  and groaning underneath this ages yoke  have wishd that noble brutus had his eyes  into what dangers would you lead me cassius  that you would have me seek into myself  for that which is not in me  therefore good brutus be prepared to hear  and since you know you cannot see yourself  so well as by reflection i your glass  will modestly discover to yourself  that of yourself which you yet know not of  and be not jealous on me gentle brutus  were i a common laugher or did use  to stale with ordinary oaths my love  to every new protester if you know  that i do fawn on men and hug them hard  and after scandal them or if you know  that i profess myself in banqueting  to all the rout then hold me dangerous  flourish and shout  what means this shouting i do fear the people  choose caesar for their king  ay do you fear it  then must i think you would not have it so  i would not cassius yet i love him well  but wherefore do you hold me here so long  what is it that you would impart to me  if it be aught toward the general good  set honour in one eye and death i the other  and i will look on both indifferently  for let the gods so speed me as i love  the name of honour more than i fear death  i know that virtue to be in you brutus  as well as i do know your outward favour  well honour is the subject of my story  i cannot tell what you and other men  think of this life but for my single self  i had as lief not be as live to be  in awe of such a thing as i myself  i was born free as caesar so were you  we both have fed as well and we can both  endure the winters cold as well as he  for once upon a raw and gusty day  the troubled tiber chafing with her shores  caesar said to me darest thou cassius now  leap in with me into this angry flood  and swim to yonder point upon the word  accoutred as i was i plunged in  and bade him follow so indeed he did  the torrent roard and we did buffet it  with lusty sinews throwing it aside  and stemming it with hearts of controversy  but ere we could arrive the point proposed  caesar cried help me cassius or i sink  i as aeneas our great ancestor  did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder  the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber  did i the tired caesar and this man  is now become a god and cassius is  a wretched creature and must bend his body  if caesar carelessly but nod on him  he had a fever when he was in spain  and when the fit was on him i did mark  how he did shake tis true this god did shake  his coward lips did from their colour fly  and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world  did lose his lustre i did hear him groan  ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans  mark him and write his speeches in their books  alas it cried give me some drink titinius  as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me  a man of such a feeble temper should  so get the start of the majestic world  and bear the palm alone  shout flourish  another general shout  i do believe that these applauses are  for some new honours that are heapd on caesar  why man he doth bestride the narrow world  like a colossus and we petty men  walk under his huge legs and peep about  to find ourselves dishonourable graves  men at some time are masters of their fates  the fault dear brutus is not in our stars  but in ourselves that we are underlings  brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar  why should that name be sounded more than yours  write them together yours is as fair a name  sound them it doth become the mouth as well  weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em  brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar  now in the names of all the gods at once  upon what meat doth this our caesar feed  that he is grown so great age thou art shamed  rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods  when went there by an age since the great flood  but it was famed with more than with one man  when could they say till now that talkd of rome  that her wide walls encompassd but one man  now is it rome indeed and room enough  when there is in it but one only man  o you and i have heard our fathers say  there was a brutus once that would have brookd  the eternal devil to keep his state in rome  as easily as a king  that you do love me i am nothing jealous  what you would work me to i have some aim  how i have thought of this and of these times  i shall recount hereafter for this present  i would not so with love i might entreat you  be any further moved what you have said  i will consider what you have to say  i will with patience hear and find a time  both meet to hear and answer such high things  till then my noble friend chew upon this  brutus had rather be a villager  than to repute himself a son of rome  under these hard conditions as this time  is like to lay upon us  i am glad that my weak words  have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus  the games are done and caesar is returning  as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve  and he will after his sour fashion tell you  what hath proceeded worthy note today  reenter caesar and his train  i will do so but look you cassius  the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow  and all the rest look like a chidden train  calpurnias cheek is pale and cicero  looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes  as we have seen him in the capitol  being crossd in conference by some senators  casca will tell us what the matter is  antonius  caesar  let me have men about me that are fat  sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights  yond cassius has a lean and hungry look  he thinks too much such men are dangerous  fear him not caesar hes not dangerous  he is a noble roman and well given  would he were fatter but i fear him not  yet if my name were liable to fear  i do not know the man i should avoid  so soon as that spare cassius he reads much  he is a great observer and he looks  quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays  as thou dost antony he hears no music  seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort  as if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit  that could be moved to smile at any thing  such men as he be never at hearts ease  whiles they behold a greater than themselves  and therefore are they very dangerous  i rather tell thee what is to be feard  than what i fear for always i am caesar  come on my right hand for this ear is deaf  and tell me truly what thou thinkst of him  sennet exeunt caesar and all his train but casca  you pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me  ay casca tell us what hath chanced today  that caesar looks so sad  why you were with him were you not  i should not then ask casca what had chanced  why there was a crown offered him and being  offered him he put it by with the back of his hand  thus and then the people fell ashouting  what was the second noise for  why for that too  they shouted thrice what was the last cry for  why for that too  was the crown offered him thrice  ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every  time gentler than other and at every puttingby  mine honest neighbours shouted  who offered him the crown  why antony  tell us the manner of it gentle casca  i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it  it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark  antony offer him a crownyet twas not a crown  neither twas one of these coronetsand as i told  you he put it by once but for all that to my  thinking he would fain have had it then he  offered it to him again then he put it by again  but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his  fingers off it and then he offered it the third  time he put it the third time by and still as he  refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their  chapped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps  and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because  caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked  caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and  for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of  opening my lips and receiving the bad air  but soft i pray you what did caesar swound  he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at  mouth and was speechless  tis very like he hath the failing sickness  no caesar hath it not but you and i  and honest casca we have the falling sickness  i know not what you mean by that but i am sure  caesar fell down if the tagrag people did not  clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and  displeased them as they use to do the players in  the theatre i am no true man  what said he when he came unto himself  marry before he fell down when he perceived the  common herd was glad he refused the crown he  plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his  throat to cut an i had been a man of any  occupation if i would not have taken him at a word  i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so  he fell when he came to himself again he said  if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired  their worships to think it was his infirmity three  or four wenches where i stood cried alas good  soul and forgave him with all their hearts but  theres no heed to be taken of them if caesar had  stabbed their mothers they would have done no less  and after that he came thus sad away  ay  did cicero say any thing  ay he spoke greek  to what effect  nay an i tell you that ill neer look you i the  face again but those that understood him smiled at  one another and shook their heads but for mine own  part it was greek to me i could tell you more  news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs  off caesars images are put to silence fare you  well there was more foolery yet if i could  remember it  will you sup with me tonight casca  no i am promised forth  will you dine with me tomorrow  ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner  worth the eating  good i will expect you  do so farewell both  exit  what a blunt fellow is this grown to be  he was quick mettle when he went to school  so is he now in execution  of any bold or noble enterprise  however he puts on this tardy form  this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit  which gives men stomach to digest his words  with better appetite  and so it is for this time i will leave you  tomorrow if you please to speak with me  i will come home to you or if you will  come home to me and i will wait for you  i will do so till then think of the world  exit brutus  well brutus thou art noble yet i see  thy honourable metal may be wrought  from that it is disposed therefore it is meet  that noble minds keep ever with their likes  for who so firm that cannot be seduced  caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus  if i were brutus now and he were cassius  he should not humour me i will this night  in several hands in at his windows throw  as if they came from several citizens  writings all tending to the great opinion  that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely  caesars ambition shall be glanced at  and after this let caesar seat him sure  for we will shake him or worse days endure  exit  scene iii the same a street  thunder and lightning enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and cicero  good even casca brought you caesar home  why are you breathless and why stare you so  are not you moved when all the sway of earth  shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero  i have seen tempests when the scolding winds  have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen  the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam  to be exalted with the threatening clouds  but never till tonight never till now  did i go through a tempest dropping fire  either there is a civil strife in heaven  or else the world too saucy with the gods  incenses them to send destruction  why saw you any thing more wonderful  a common slaveyou know him well by sight  held up his left hand which did flame and burn  like twenty torches joind and yet his hand  not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd  besidesi ha not since put up my sword  against the capitol i met a lion  who glared upon me and went surly by  without annoying me and there were drawn  upon a heap a hundred ghastly women  transformed with their fear who swore they saw  men all in fire walk up and down the streets  and yesterday the bird of night did sit  even at noonday upon the marketplace  hooting and shrieking when these prodigies  do so conjointly meet let not men say  these are their reasons they are natural  for i believe they are portentous things  unto the climate that they point upon  indeed it is a strangedisposed time  but men may construe things after their fashion  clean from the purpose of the things themselves  come caesar to the capitol tomorrow  he doth for he did bid antonius  send word to you he would be there tomorrow  good night then casca this disturbed sky  is not to walk in  farewell cicero  exit cicero  enter cassius  whos there  a roman  casca by your voice  your ear is good cassius what night is this  a very pleasing night to honest men  who ever knew the heavens menace so  those that have known the earth so full of faults  for my part i have walkd about the streets  submitting me unto the perilous night  and thus unbraced casca as you see  have bared my bosom to the thunderstone  and when the cross blue lightning seemd to open  the breast of heaven i did present myself  even in the aim and very flash of it  but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens  it is the part of men to fear and tremble  when the most mighty gods by tokens send  such dreadful heralds to astonish us  you are dull casca and those sparks of life  that should be in a roman you do want  or else you use not you look pale and gaze  and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder  to see the strange impatience of the heavens  but if you would consider the true cause  why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts  why birds and beasts from quality and kind  why old men fool and children calculate  why all these things change from their ordinance  their natures and preformed faculties  to monstrous qualitywhy you shall find  that heaven hath infused them with these spirits  to make them instruments of fear and warning  unto some monstrous state  now could i casca name to thee a man  most like this dreadful night  that thunders lightens opens graves and roars  as doth the lion in the capitol  a man no mightier than thyself or me  in personal action yet prodigious grown  and fearful as these strange eruptions are  tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius  let it be who it is for romans now  have thews and limbs like to their ancestors  but woe the while our fathers minds are dead  and we are governd with our mothers spirits  our yoke and sufferance show us womanish  indeed they say the senators tomorrow  mean to establish caesar as a king  and he shall wear his crown by sea and land  in every place save here in italy  i know where i will wear this dagger then  cassius from bondage will deliver cassius  therein ye gods you make the weak most strong  therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat  nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass  nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron  can be retentive to the strength of spirit  but life being weary of these worldly bars  never lacks power to dismiss itself  if i know this know all the world besides  that part of tyranny that i do bear  i can shake off at pleasure  thunder still  so can i  so every bondman in his own hand bears  the power to cancel his captivity  and why should caesar be a tyrant then  poor man i know he would not be a wolf  but that he sees the romans are but sheep  he were no lion were not romans hinds  those that with haste will make a mighty fire  begin it with weak straws what trash is rome  what rubbish and what offal when it serves  for the base matter to illuminate  so vile a thing as caesar but o grief  where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this  before a willing bondman then i know  my answer must be made but i am armd  and dangers are to me indifferent  you speak to casca and to such a man  that is no fleering telltale hold my hand  be factious for redress of all these griefs  and i will set this foot of mine as far  as who goes farthest  theres a bargain made  now know you casca i have moved already  some certain of the noblestminded romans  to undergo with me an enterprise  of honourabledangerous consequence  and i do know by this they stay for me  in pompeys porch for now this fearful night  there is no stir or walking in the streets  and the complexion of the element  in favours like the work we have in hand  most bloody fiery and most terrible  stand close awhile for here comes one in haste  tis cinna i do know him by his gait  he is a friend  enter cinna  cinna where haste you so  to find out you whos that metellus cimber  no it is casca one incorporate  to our attempts am i not stayd for cinna  i am glad on t what a fearful night is this  theres two or three of us have seen strange sights  am i not stayd for tell me  yes you are  o cassius if you could  but win the noble brutus to our party  be you content good cinna take this paper  and look you lay it in the praetors chair  where brutus may but find it and throw this  in at his window set this up with wax  upon old brutus statue all this done  repair to pompeys porch where you shall find us  is decius brutus and trebonius there  all but metellus cimber and hes gone  to seek you at your house well i will hie  and so bestow these papers as you bade me  that done repair to pompeys theatre  exit cinna  come casca you and i will yet ere day  see brutus at his house three parts of him  is ours already and the man entire  upon the next encounter yields him ours  o he sits high in all the peoples hearts  and that which would appear offence in us  his countenance like richest alchemy  will change to virtue and to worthiness  him and his worth and our great need of him  you have right well conceited let us go  for it is after midnight and ere day  we will awake him and be sure of him  exeunt  act ii  scene i rome brutuss orchard  enter brutus  what lucius ho  i cannot by the progress of the stars  give guess how near to day lucius i say  i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly  when lucius when awake i say what lucius  enter lucius  calld you my lord  get me a taper in my study lucius  when it is lighted come and call me here  i will my lord  exit  it must be by his death and for my part  i know no personal cause to spurn at him  but for the general he would be crownd  how that might change his nature theres the question  it is the bright day that brings forth the adder  and that craves wary walking crown himthat  and then i grant we put a sting in him  that at his will he may do danger with  the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins  remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar  i have not known when his affections swayd  more than his reason but tis a common proof  that lowliness is young ambitions ladder  whereto the climberupward turns his face  but when he once attains the upmost round  he then unto the ladder turns his back  looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees  by which he did ascend so caesar may  then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel  will bear no colour for the thing he is  fashion it thus that what he is augmented  would run to these and these extremities  and therefore think him as a serpents egg  which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous  and kill him in the shell  reenter lucius  the taper burneth in your closet sir  searching the window for a flint i found  this paper thus seald up and i am sure  it did not lie there when i went to bed  gives him the letter  get you to bed again it is not day  is not tomorrow boy the ides of march  i know not sir  look in the calendar and bring me word  i will sir  exit  the exhalations whizzing in the air  give so much light that i may read by them  opens the letter and reads  brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself  shall rome  and c speak strike redress  brutus thou sleepst awake  such instigations have been often droppd  where i have took them up  shall rome  and c thus must i piece it out  shall rome stand under one mans awe what rome  my ancestors did from the streets of rome  the tarquin drive when he was calld a king  speak strike redress am i entreated  to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise  if the redress will follow thou receivest  thy full petition at the hand of brutus  reenter lucius  sir march is wasted fourteen days  knocking within  tis good go to the gate somebody knocks  exit lucius  since cassius first did whet me against caesar  i have not slept  between the acting of a dreadful thing  and the first motion all the interim is  like a phantasma or a hideous dream  the genius and the mortal instruments  are then in council and the state of man  like to a little kingdom suffers then  the nature of an insurrection  reenter lucius  sir tis your brother cassius at the door  who doth desire to see you  is he alone  no sir there are moe with him  do you know them  no sir their hats are pluckd about their ears  and half their faces buried in their cloaks  that by no means i may discover them  by any mark of favour  let em enter  exit lucius  they are the faction o conspiracy  shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night  when evils are most free o then by day  where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough  to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy  hide it in smiles and affability  for if thou path thy native semblance on  not erebus itself were dim enough  to hide thee from prevention  enter the conspirators cassius casca decius brutus cinna metellus cimber and trebonius  i think we are too bold upon your rest  good morrow brutus do we trouble you  i have been up this hour awake all night  know i these men that come along with you  yes every man of them and no man here  but honours you and every one doth wish  you had but that opinion of yourself  which every noble roman bears of you  this is trebonius  he is welcome hither  this decius brutus  he is welcome too  this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber  they are all welcome  what watchful cares do interpose themselves  betwixt your eyes and night  shall i entreat a word  brutus and cassius whisper  here lies the east doth not the day break here  no  o pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines  that fret the clouds are messengers of day  you shall confess that you are both deceived  here as i point my sword the sun arises  which is a great way growing on the south  weighing the youthful season of the year  some two months hence up higher toward the north  he first presents his fire and the high east  stands as the capitol directly here  give me your hands all over one by one  and let us swear our resolution  no not an oath if not the face of men  the sufferance of our souls the times abuse  if these be motives weak break off betimes  and every man hence to his idle bed  so let highsighted tyranny range on  till each man drop by lottery but if these  as i am sure they do bear fire enough  to kindle cowards and to steel with valour  the melting spirits of women then countrymen  what need we any spur but our own cause  to prick us to redress what other bond  than secret romans that have spoke the word  and will not palter and what other oath  than honesty to honesty engaged  that this shall be or we will fall for it  swear priests and cowards and men cautelous  old feeble carrions and such suffering souls  that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear  such creatures as men doubt but do not stain  the even virtue of our enterprise  nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits  to think that or our cause or our performance  did need an oath when every drop of blood  that every roman bears and nobly bears  is guilty of a several bastardy  if he do break the smallest particle  of any promise that hath passd from him  but what of cicero shall we sound him  i think he will stand very strong with us  let us not leave him out  no by no means  o let us have him for his silver hairs  will purchase us a good opinion  and buy mens voices to commend our deeds  it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands  our youths and wildness shall no whit appear  but all be buried in his gravity  o name him not let us not break with him  for he will never follow any thing  that other men begin  then leave him out  indeed he is not fit  shall no man else be touchd but only caesar  decius well urged i think it is not meet  mark antony so well beloved of caesar  should outlive caesar we shall find of him  a shrewd contriver and you know his means  if he improve them may well stretch so far  as to annoy us all which to prevent  let antony and caesar fall together  our course will seem too bloody caius cassius  to cut the head off and then hack the limbs  like wrath in death and envy afterwards  for antony is but a limb of caesar  let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius  we all stand up against the spirit of caesar  and in the spirit of men there is no blood  o that we then could come by caesars spirit  and not dismember caesar but alas  caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends  lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully  lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods  not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds  and let our hearts as subtle masters do  stir up their servants to an act of rage  and after seem to chide em this shall make  our purpose necessary and not envious  which so appearing to the common eyes  we shall be calld purgers not murderers  and for mark antony think not of him  for he can do no more than caesars arm  when caesars head is off  yet i fear him  for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar  alas good cassius do not think of him  if he love caesar all that he can do  is to himself take thought and die for caesar  and that were much he should for he is given  to sports to wildness and much company  there is no fear in him let him not die  for he will live and laugh at this hereafter  clock strikes  peace count the clock  the clock hath stricken three  tis time to part  but it is doubtful yet  whether caesar will come forth today or no  for he is superstitious grown of late  quite from the main opinion he held once  of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies  it may be these apparent prodigies  the unaccustomd terror of this night  and the persuasion of his augurers  may hold him from the capitol today  never fear that if he be so resolved  i can oersway him for he loves to hear  that unicorns may be betrayd with trees  and bears with glasses elephants with holes  lions with toils and men with flatterers  but when i tell him he hates flatterers  he says he does being then most flattered  let me work  for i can give his humour the true bent  and i will bring him to the capitol  nay we will all of us be there to fetch him  by the eighth hour is that the uttermost  be that the uttermost and fail not then  caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard  who rated him for speaking well of pompey  i wonder none of you have thought of him  now good metellus go along by him  he loves me well and i have given him reasons  send him but hither and ill fashion him  the morning comes upon s well leave you brutus  and friends disperse yourselves but all remember  what you have said and show yourselves true romans  good gentlemen look fresh and merrily  let not our looks put on our purposes  but bear it as our roman actors do  with untired spirits and formal constancy  and so good morrow to you every one  exeunt all but brutus  boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter  enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber  thou hast no figures nor no fantasies  which busy care draws in the brains of men  therefore thou sleepst so sound  enter portia  brutus my lord  portia what mean you wherefore rise you now  it is not for your health thus to commit  your weak condition to the raw cold morning  nor for yours neither youve ungently brutus  stole from my bed and yesternight at supper  you suddenly arose and walkd about  musing and sighing with your arms across  and when i askd you what the matter was  you stared upon me with ungentle looks  i urged you further then you scratchd your head  and too impatiently stampd with your foot  yet i insisted yet you answerd not  but with an angry wafture of your hand  gave sign for me to leave you so i did  fearing to strengthen that impatience  which seemd too much enkindled and withal  hoping it was but an effect of humour  which sometime hath his hour with every man  it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep  and could it work so much upon your shape  as it hath much prevaild on your condition  i should not know you brutus dear my lord  make me acquainted with your cause of grief  i am not well in health and that is all  brutus is wise and were he not in health  he would embrace the means to come by it  why so i do good portia go to bed  is brutus sick and is it physical  to walk unbraced and suck up the humours  of the dank morning what is brutus sick  and will he steal out of his wholesome bed  to dare the vile contagion of the night  and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air  to add unto his sickness no my brutus  you have some sick offence within your mind  which by the right and virtue of my place  i ought to know of and upon my knees  i charm you by my oncecommended beauty  by all your vows of love and that great vow  which did incorporate and make us one  that you unfold to me yourself your half  why you are heavy and what men tonight  have had to resort to you for here have been  some six or seven who did hide their faces  even from darkness  kneel not gentle portia  i should not need if you were gentle brutus  within the bond of marriage tell me brutus  is it excepted i should know no secrets  that appertain to you am i yourself  but as it were in sort or limitation  to keep with you at meals comfort your bed  and talk to you sometimes dwell i but in the suburbs  of your good pleasure if it be no more  portia is brutus harlot not his wife  you are my true and honourable wife  as dear to me as are the ruddy drops  that visit my sad heart  if this were true then should i know this secret  i grant i am a woman but withal  a woman that lord brutus took to wife  i grant i am a woman but withal  a woman wellreputed catos daughter  think you i am no stronger than my sex  being so fatherd and so husbanded  tell me your counsels i will not disclose em  i have made strong proof of my constancy  giving myself a voluntary wound  here in the thigh can i bear that with patience  and not my husbands secrets  o ye gods  render me worthy of this noble wife  knocking within  hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile  and by and by thy bosom shall partake  the secrets of my heart  all my engagements i will construe to thee  all the charactery of my sad brows  leave me with haste  exit portia  lucius whos that knocks  reenter lucius with ligarius  he is a sick man that would speak with you  caius ligarius that metellus spake of  boy stand aside caius ligarius how  vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue  o what a time have you chose out brave caius  to wear a kerchief would you were not sick  i am not sick if brutus have in hand  any exploit worthy the name of honour  such an exploit have i in hand ligarius  had you a healthful ear to hear of it  by all the gods that romans bow before  i here discard my sickness soul of rome  brave son derived from honourable loins  thou like an exorcist hast conjured up  my mortified spirit now bid me run  and i will strive with things impossible  yea get the better of them whats to do  a piece of work that will make sick men whole  but are not some whole that we must make sick  that must we also

what mean you caesar think you to walk forth  you shall not stir out of your house today  caesar shall forth the things that threatend me  neer lookd but on my back when they shall see  the face of caesar they are vanished  caesar i never stood on ceremonies  yet now they fright me there is one within  besides the things that we have heard and seen  recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch  a lioness hath whelped in the streets  and graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead  fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds  in ranks and squadrons and right form of war  which drizzled blood upon the capitol  the noise of battle hurtled in the air  horses did neigh and dying men did groan  and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets  o caesar these things are beyond all use  and i do fear them  what can be avoided  whose end is purposed by the mighty gods  yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions  are to the world in general as to caesar  when beggars die there are no comets seen  the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes  cowards die many times before their deaths  the valiant never taste of death but once  of all the wonders that i yet have heard  it seems to me most strange that men should fear  seeing that death a necessary end  will come when it will come  reenter servant  what say the augurers  they would not have you to stir forth today  plucking the entrails of an offering forth  they could not find a heart within the beast  the gods do this in shame of cowardice  caesar should be a beast without a heart  if he should stay at home today for fear  no caesar shall not danger knows full well  that caesar is more dangerous than he  we are two lions litterd in one day  and i the elder and more terrible  and caesar shall go forth  alas my lord  your wisdom is consumed in confidence  do not go forth today call it my fear  that keeps you in the house and not your own  well send mark antony to the senatehouse  and he shall say you

graybeards the truth  decius go tell them caesar will not come  most mighty caesar let me know some cause  lest i be laughd at when i tell them so  the cause is in my will i will not come  that is enough to satisfy the senate  but for your private satisfaction  because i love you i will let you know  calpurnia here my wife stays me at home  she dreamt tonight she saw my statua  which like a fountain with an hundred spouts  did run pure blood and many lusty romans  came smiling and did bathe their hands in it  and these does she apply for warnings and portents  and evils imminent and on her knee  hath beggd that i will stay at home today  this dream is all amiss interpreted  it was a vision fair and fortunate  your statue spouting blood in many pipes  in which so many smiling romans bathed  signifies that from you great rome shall suck  reviving blood and that great men shall press  for tinctures stains relics and cognizance  this by calpurnias dream is signified  and this way have you well expounded it  i have when you have heard what i can say  and know it now the senate have concluded  to give this day a crown to mighty caesar  if you shall send them word you will not come  their minds may change besides it were a mock  apt to be renderd for some one to say  break up the senate till another time  when caesars wife shall meet with better dreams  if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper  lo caesar is afraid  pardon me caesar for my dear dear love  to our proceeding bids me tell you this  and reason to my love is liable  how foolish do your fears seem

kneeling  i must prevent thee cimber  these couchings and these lowly courtesies  might fire the blood of ordinary men  and turn preordinance and first decree  into the law of children be not fond  to think that caesar bears such rebel blood  that will be thawd from the true quality  with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words  lowcrooked courtsies and base spanielfawning  thy brother by decree is banished  if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him  i spurn thee like a cur out of my way  know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause  will he be satisfied  is there no voice more worthy than my own  to sound more sweetly in great caesars ear  for the repealing of my banishd brother  i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar  desiring thee that publius cimber may  have an immediate freedom of repeal  what brutus  pardon caesar caesar pardon  as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall  to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber  i could be well moved if i were as you  if i

will grace his heels  with the most boldest and best hearts of rome  enter a servant  soft who comes here a friend of antonys  thus brutus did my master bid me kneel  thus did mark antony bid me fall down  and being prostrate thus he bade me say  brutus is noble wise valiant and honest  caesar was mighty bold royal and loving  say i love brutus and i honour him  say i feard caesar honourd him and loved him  if brutus will vouchsafe that antony  may safely come to him and be resolved  how caesar hath deserved to lie in death  mark antony shall not love caesar dead  so well as brutus living but will follow  the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus  thorough the hazards of this untrod state  with all true faith so says my master antony  thy master is a wise and valiant roman  i never thought him worse  tell him so please him come unto this place  he shall be satisfied and by my honour  depart untouchd  ill fetch him presently  exit  i know that we shall have him well to friend  i wish we may but yet have i a mind  that fears him much and my misgiving still  falls shrewdly to the purpose  but here comes antony  reenter antony  welcome mark antony  o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low  are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils  shrunk to this little measure fare thee well  i know not gentlemen what you intend  who else must be let blood who else is rank  if i myself there is no

reverence  your voice shall be as strong as any mans  in the disposing of new dignities  only be patient till we have appeased  the multitude beside themselves with fear  and then we will deliver you the cause  why i that did love caesar when i struck him  have thus proceeded  i doubt not of your wisdom  let each man render me his bloody hand  first marcus brutus will i shake with you  next caius cassius do i take your hand  now decius brutus yours now yours metellus  yours cinna and my valiant casca yours  though last not last in love yours good trebonius  gentlemen allalas what shall i say  my credit now stands on such slippery ground  that one of two bad ways you must conceit me  either a coward or a flatterer  that i did love thee caesar o tis true  if then thy spirit look upon us now  shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death  to see thy thy anthony making his peace  shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes  most noble in the presence of thy corse  had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds  weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood  it would become me better than to close  in terms of friendship with thine enemies  pardon me julius here wast thou bayd brave hart  here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand  signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy lethe  o world thou wast the forest to this hart  and this indeed o world the heart of thee  how like a deer strucken by many princes  dost thou here lie  mark antony  pardon me caius cassius  the enemies of caesar shall say this  then in a friend it is cold modesty  i blame you not for praising caesar so  but what compact mean you to have with us  will you be prickd in number of our friends  or shall we on and not depend on you  therefore i took your hands but was indeed  swayd from the point by looking down on caesar  friends am i with you all and love you all  upon this hope that you shall give me reasons  why and wherein caesar was dangerous  or else were this a savage spectacle  our reasons are so full of good regard  that were you antony the son of caesar  you should be satisfied  thats all i seek  and am moreover suitor that i may  produce his body to the marketplace  and in the pulpit as becomes a friend  speak in the order of his funeral  you shall mark antony  brutus a word with you  aside to brutus  you know not what you do do not consent  that antony speak in his funeral  know you how much the people may be moved  by that which he will utter  by your pardon  i will myself into the pulpit first  and show the reason of our caesars death  what antony shall speak i will protest  he speaks by leave and by permission  and that we are contented caesar shall  have all true rites and lawful ceremonies  it shall advantage more than do us wrong  i know not what may fall i like it not  mark antony here take you caesars body  you shall not in your funeral speech blame us  but speak all good you can devise of caesar  and say you dot by our permission  else shall you not have any hand at all  about his funeral and you shall speak  in the same pulpit whereto i am going  after my speech is ended  be it so  i do desire no more  prepare the body then and follow us  exeunt all but antony  o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth  that i am meek and gentle with these butchers  thou art the ruins of the noblest man  that ever lived in the tide of times  woe to the hand that shed this costly blood  over thy wounds now do i prophesy  which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips  to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue  a curse shall light upon the limbs of men  domestic fury and fierce civil strife  shall cumber all the parts of italy  blood and destruction shall be so in use  and dreadful objects so familiar  that mothers shall but smile when they behold  their infants quarterd with the hands of war  all pity choked with custom of fell deeds  and caesars spirit ranging for revenge  with ate by his side come hot from hell  shall in these confines with a monarchs voice  cry  havoc and let slip the dogs of war  that this foul deed shall smell above the earth  with carrion men groaning for burial  enter a servant  you serve octavius caesar do you not  i do mark antony  caesar did write for him to come to rome  he did receive his letters and is coming  and bid me say to you by word of mouth  o caesar  seeing the body  thy heart is big get thee apart and weep  passion i see is catching for mine eyes  seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine  began to water is thy master coming  he lies tonight within seven leagues of rome  post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced  here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome  no rome of safety for octavius yet  hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile  thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse  into the marketplace there shall i try  in my oration how the people take  the cruel issue of these bloody men  according to the which thou shalt discourse  to young octavius of the state of things  lend me your hand  exeunt with caesars body  scene ii the forum  enter brutus and cassius and a throng of citizens  we will be satisfied let us be satisfied  then follow me and give me audience friends  cassius go you into the other street  and part the numbers  those that will hear me speak let em stay here  those that will follow cassius go with him  and public reasons shall be rendered  of caesars death  i will hear brutus speak  i will hear cassius and compare their reasons  when severally we hear them rendered  exit cassius with some of the citizens brutus goes into the pulpit  the noble brutus is ascended silence  be patient till the last  romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my  cause and be silent that you may hear believe me  for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that  you may believe censure me in your wisdom and  awake your senses that you may the better judge  if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of  caesars to him i say that brutus love to caesar  was no less than his if then that friend demand  why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer  not that i loved caesar less but that i loved  rome more had you rather caesar were living and  die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live  all free men as caesar loved me i weep for him  as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was  valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i  slew him there is tears for his love joy for his  fortune honour for his valour and death for his  ambition who is here so base that would be a  bondman if any speak for him have i offended  who is here so rude that would not be a roman if  any speak for him have i offended who is here so  vile that will not love his country if any speak  for him have i offended i pause for a reply  none brutus none  then none have i offended i have done no more to  caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of  his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not  extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences  enforced for which he suffered death  enter antony and others with caesars body  here comes his body mourned by mark antony who  though he had no hand in his death shall receive  the benefit of his dying a place in the  commonwealth as which of you shall not with this  i departthat as i slew my best lover for the  good of rome i have the same dagger for myself  when it shall please my country to need my death  live brutus live live  bring him with triumph home unto his house  give him a statue with his ancestors  let him be caesar  caesars better parts  shall be crownd in brutus  well bring him to his house  with shouts and clamours  my countrymen  peace silence brutus speaks  peace ho  good countrymen let me depart alone  and for my sake stay here with antony  do grace to caesars corpse and grace his speech  tending to caesars glories which mark antony  by our permission is allowd to make  i do entreat you not a man depart  save i alone till antony have spoke  exit  stay ho and let us hear mark antony  let him go up into the public chair  well hear him noble antony go up  for brutus sake i am beholding to you  goes into the pulpit  what does he say of brutus  he says for brutus sake  he finds himself beholding to us all  twere best he speak no harm of brutus here  this caesar was a tyrant  nay thats certain  we are blest that rome is rid of him  peace let us hear what antony can say  you gentle romans  peace ho let us hear him  friends romans countrymen lend me your ears  i come to bury caesar not to praise him  the evil that men do lives after them  the good is oft interred with their bones  so let it be with caesar the noble brutus  hath told you caesar was ambitious  if it were so it was a grievous fault  and grievously hath caesar answerd it  here under leave of brutus and the rest  for brutus is an honourable man  so are they all all honourable men  come i to speak in caesars funeral  he was my friend faithful and just to me  but brutus says he was ambitious  and brutus is an honourable man  he hath brought many captives home to rome  whose ransoms did the general coffers fill  did this in caesar seem ambitious  when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept  ambition should be made of sterner stuff  yet brutus says he was ambitious  and brutus is an honourable man  you all did see that on the lupercal  i thrice presented him a kingly crown  which he did thrice refuse was this ambition  yet brutus says he was ambitious  and sure he is an honourable man  i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke  but here i am to speak what i do know  you all did love him once not without cause  what cause withholds you then to mourn for him  o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts  and men have lost their reason bear with me  my heart is in the coffin there with caesar  and i must pause till it come back to me  methinks there is much reason in his sayings  if thou consider rightly of the matter  caesar has had great wrong  has he masters  i fear there will a worse come in his place  markd ye his words he would not take the crown  therefore tis certain he was not ambitious  if it be found so some will dear abide it  poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping  theres not a nobler man in rome than antony  now mark him he begins again to speak  but yesterday the word of caesar might  have stood against the world now lies he there  and none so poor to do him reverence  o masters if i were disposed to stir  your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage  i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong  who you all know are honourable men  i will not do them wrong i rather choose  to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you  than i will wrong such honourable men  but heres a parchment with the seal of caesar  i found it in his closet tis his will  let but the commons hear this testament  which pardon me i do not mean to read  and they would go and kiss dead caesars wounds  and dip their napkins in his sacred blood  yea beg a hair of him for memory  and dying mention it within their wills  bequeathing it as a rich legacy  unto their issue  well hear the will read it mark antony  the will the will we will hear caesars will  have patience gentle friends i must not read it  it is not meet you know how caesar loved you  you are not wood you are not stones but men  and being men bearing the will of caesar  it will inflame you it will make you mad  tis good you know not that you are his heirs  for if you should o what would come of it  read the will well hear it antony  you shall read us the will caesars will  will you be patient will you stay awhile  i have oershot myself to tell you of it  i fear i wrong the honourable men  whose daggers have stabbd caesar i do fear it  they were traitors honourable men  the will the testament  they were villains murderers the will read the will  you will compel me then to read the will  then make a ring about the corpse of caesar  and let me show you him that made the will  shall i descend and will you give me leave  come down  descend  you shall have leave  antony comes down  a ring stand round  stand from the hearse stand from the body  room for antony most noble antony  nay press not so upon me stand far off  stand back room bear back  if you have tears prepare to shed them now  you all do know this mantle i remember  the first time ever caesar put it on  twas on a summers evening in his tent  that day he overcame the nervii  look in this place ran cassius dagger through  see what a rent the envious casca made  through this the wellbeloved brutus stabbd  and as he pluckd his cursed steel away  mark how the blood of caesar followd it  as rushing out of doors to be resolved  if brutus so unkindly knockd or no  for brutus as you know was caesars angel  judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him  this was the most unkindest cut of all  for when the noble caesar saw him stab  ingratitude more strong than traitors arms  quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart  and in his mantle muffling up his face  even at the base of pompeys statua  which all the while ran blood great caesar fell  o what a fall was there my countrymen  then i and you and all of us fell down  whilst bloody treason flourishd over us  o now you weep and i perceive you feel  the dint of pity these are gracious drops  kind souls what weep you when you but behold  our caesars vesture wounded look you here  here is himself marrd as you see with traitors  o piteous spectacle  o noble caesar  o woful day  o traitors

well die with him  good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up  to such a sudden flood of mutiny  they that have done this deed are honourable  what private griefs they have alas i know not  that made them do it they are wise and honourable  and will no doubt with reasons answer you  i come not friends to steal away your hearts  i am no orator as brutus is  but as you know me all a plain blunt man  that love my friend and that they know full well  that gave me public leave to speak of him  for i have neither wit nor words nor worth  action nor utterance nor the power of speech  to stir mens blood i only speak right on  i tell you that which you yourselves do know  show you sweet caesars wounds poor poor dumb mouths  and bid them speak for me but were i brutus  and brutus antony there were an antony  would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue  in every wound of caesar that should move  the stones of rome to rise and mutiny  well mutiny  well burn the house of brutus  away

slight unmeritable man  meet to be sent on errands is it fit  the threefold world divided he should stand  one of the three to share it  so you thought him  and took his voice who should be prickd to die  in our black sentence and proscription  octavius i have seen more days than you  and though we lay these honours on this man  to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads  he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold  to groan and sweat under the business  either led or driven as we point the way  and having brought our treasure where we will  then take we down his load and turn him off  like to the empty ass to shake his ears  and graze in commons  you may do your will  but hes a tried and valiant soldier  so is my horse octavius and for that  i do appoint him store of provender  it is a creature that i teach to fight  to wind to stop to run directly on  his corporal motion governd by my spirit  and in some taste is lepidus but so  he must be taught and traind and bid go forth  a

lucilius is cassius near  he is at hand and pindarus is come  to do you salutation from his master  he greets me well your master pindarus  in his own change or by ill officers  hath given me some worthy cause to wish  things done undone but if he be at hand  i shall be satisfied  i do not doubt  but that my noble master will appear  such as he is full of regard and honour  he is not doubted a word lucilius  how he received you let me be resolved  with courtesy and with respect enough  but not with such familiar instances  nor with such free and friendly conference  as he hath used of old  thou hast described  a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius  when love begins to sicken and decay  it useth an enforced ceremony  there are no tricks in plain and simple faith  but hollow men like horses hot at hand  make gallant show and promise of their mettle  but when they should endure the bloody spur  they fall their crests and like deceitful jades  sink in the trial comes his army on

powers  stand ho  stand ho speak the word along  stand  stand  stand  most noble brother you have done me wrong  judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies  and if not so how should i wrong a brother  brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs  and when you do them  cassius be content  speak your griefs softly i do know you well  before the eyes of both our armies here  which should perceive nothing but love from us  let us not wrangle bid them move away  then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs  and i will give you audience  pindarus  bid our commanders lead their charges off  a little from this ground  lucilius do you the like and let no man  come to our tent till we have done our conference  let lucius and titinius guard our door  exeunt  scene iii brutuss tent  enter brutus and cassius  that you have wrongd me doth appear in this  you have condemnd and noted lucius pella  for taking bribes here of the sardians  wherein my letters praying on his side  because i knew the man were slighted off  you wronged yourself to write in such a case  in such a time as this it is not meet  that every nice offence should bear his comment  let me tell you cassius you yourself  are much condemnd to have an itching palm  to sell and mart your offices for gold  to undeservers  i an itching palm  you know that you are brutus that speak this  or by the gods this speech were else your last  the name of cassius honours this corruption  and chastisement doth therefore hide his head  chastisement  remember march the ides of march remember  did not great julius bleed for justice sake  what villain touchd his body that did stab  and not for justice what shall one of us  that struck the foremost man of all this world  but for supporting robbers shall we now  contaminate our fingers with base bribes  and sell the mighty space of our large honours  for so much trash as may be grasped thus  i had rather be a dog and bay the moon  than such a roman  brutus bay not me  ill not endure it you forget yourself  to hedge me in i am a soldier i  older in practise abler than yourself  to make conditions  go to you are not cassius  i am  i say you are not  urge me no more i shall forget myself  have mind upon your health tempt me no further  away slight man  ist possible  hear me for i will speak  must i give way and room to your rash choler  shall i be frighted when a madman stares  o ye gods ye gods must i endure all this  all this ay more fret till your proud heart break  go show your slaves how choleric you are  and make your bondmen tremble must i budge  must i observe you must i stand and crouch  under your testy humour by the gods  you shall digest the venom of your spleen  though it do split you for from this day forth  ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter  when you are waspish  is it come to this  you say you are a better soldier  let it appear so make your vaunting true  and it shall please me well for mine own part  i shall be glad to learn of noble men  you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus  i said an elder soldier not a better  did i say better  if you did i care not  when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me  peace peace you durst not so have tempted him  i durst not  no  what durst not tempt him  for your life you durst not  do not presume too much upon my love  i may do that i shall be sorry for  you have done that you should be sorry for  there is no terror cassius in your threats  for i am armd so strong in honesty  that they pass by me as the idle wind  which i respect not i did send to you  for certain sums of gold which you denied me  for i can raise no money by vile means  by heaven i had rather coin my heart  and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring  from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash  by any indirection i did send  to you for gold to pay my legions  which you denied me was that done like cassius  should i have answerd caius cassius so  when marcus brutus grows so covetous  to lock such rascal counters from his friends  be ready gods with all your thunderbolts  dash him to pieces  i denied you not  you did  i did not he was but a fool that brought  my answer back brutus hath rived my heart  a friend should bear his friends infirmities  but brutus makes mine greater than they are  i do not till you practise them on me  you love me not  i do not like your faults  a friendly eye could never see such faults  a flatterers would not though they do appear  as huge as high olympus  come antony and young octavius come  revenge yourselves alone on cassius  for cassius is aweary of the world  hated by one he loves braved by his brother  chequed like a bondman all his faults observed  set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote  to cast into my teeth o i could weep  my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger  and here my naked breast within a heart  dearer than plutus mine richer than gold  if that thou best a roman take it forth  i that denied thee gold will give my heart  strike as thou didst at caesar for i know  when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better  than ever thou lovedst cassius  sheathe your dagger  be angry when you will it shall have scope  do what you will dishonour shall be humour  o cassius you are yoked with a lamb  that carries anger as the flint bears fire  who much enforced shows a hasty spark  and straight is cold again  hath cassius lived  to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus  when grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him  when i spoke that i was illtemperd too  do you confess so much give me your hand  and my heart too  o brutus  whats the matter  have not you love enough to bear with me  when that rash humour which my mother gave me  makes me forgetful  yes cassius and from henceforth  when you are overearnest with your brutus  hell think your mother chides and leave you so  within  let me go in to see the generals  there is some grudge between em tis not meet  they be alone  within  you shall not come to them  within  nothing but death shall stay me  enter poet followed by lucilius titinius and lucius  how now whats the matter  for shame you generals what do you mean  love and be friends as two such men should be  for i have seen more years im sure than ye  ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme  get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence  bear with him brutus tis his fashion  ill know

cassius i am sick of many griefs  of your philosophy you make no use  if you give place to accidental evils  no man bears sorrow better portia is dead  ha portia  she is dead  how scaped i killing when i crossd you so  o insupportable and touching loss  upon what sickness  impatient of my absence  and grief that young octavius with mark antony  have made themselves so strongfor with her death  that tidings camewith this she fell distract  and her attendants absent swallowd fire  and died so  even so  o ye immortal gods  reenter lucius with wine and taper  speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine  in this i bury all unkindness cassius  my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge  fill lucius till the wine oerswell the cup  i cannot drink too much of brutus love  come in titinius  exit lucius  reenter titinius with messala  welcome good messala  now sit we close about this taper here  and call in question our necessities  portia art thou gone  no more i pray you  messala i have here received letters  that young octavius and mark antony  come down upon us with a mighty power  bending their expedition toward philippi  myself have letters of the selfsame tenor  with what addition  that by proscription and bills of outlawry  octavius antony and lepidus  have put to death an hundred senators  therein our letters do not well agree  mine speak of seventy senators that died  by their proscriptions cicero being one  cicero one  cicero is dead  and by that order of proscription  had you your letters from your wife my lord  no messala  nor nothing in your letters writ of her  nothing messala  that methinks is strange  why ask you hear you aught of her in yours  no my lord  now as you are a roman tell me true  then like a roman bear the truth i tell  for certain she is dead and by strange manner  why farewell portia we must die messala  with meditating that she must die once  i have the patience to endure it now  even so great men great losses should endure  i have as much of this in art as you  but yet my nature could not bear it so  well to our work alive what do you think  of marching to philippi presently  i do not think it good  your reason  this it is  tis better that the enemy seek us  so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers  doing himself offence whilst we lying still  are full of rest defense and nimbleness  good reasons must of force give place to better  the people twixt philippi and this ground  do stand but in a forced affection  for they have grudged us contribution  the enemy marching along by them  by them shall make a fuller number up  come on refreshd newadded and encouraged  from which advantage shall we cut him off  if at philippi we do face him there  these people at our back  hear me good brother  under your pardon you must note beside  that we have tried the utmost of our friends  our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe  the enemy increaseth every day  we at the height are ready to decline  there is a tide in the affairs of men  which taken at the flood leads on to fortune  omitted all the voyage of their life  is bound in shallows and in miseries  on such a full sea are we now afloat  and we must take the current when it serves  or lose our ventures  then with your will go on  well along ourselves and meet them at philippi  the deep of night is crept upon our talk  and nature must obey necessity  which we will niggard with a little rest  there is no more to say  no more good night  early tomorrow will we rise and hence  lucius  enter lucius  my gown  exit lucius  farewell good messala  good

antony our hopes are answered  you said the enemy would not come down  but keep the hills and upper regions  it proves not so their battles are at hand  they mean to warn us at philippi here  answering before we do demand of them  tut i am in their bosoms and i know  wherefore they do it they could be content  to visit other places and come down  with fearful bravery thinking by this face  to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage  but tis not so  enter a messenger  prepare you generals  the enemy comes on in gallant show  their bloody sign of battle is hung out  and something to be done immediately  octavius lead your battle softly on  upon the left hand of the even field  upon the right hand i keep thou the left  why do you cross me in this exigent  i do not cross you but i will do so  march  drum enter brutus cassius and their army lucilius titinius messala and others  they stand and would have parley  stand fast titinius we must out and talk  mark antony shall we give sign of battle  no caesar we will answer on their charge  make forth the generals would have some words  stir not until the signal  words before blows is it so countrymen  not that we love words better as you do  good words are better than bad strokes octavius  in your bad strokes brutus you give good words  witness the hole you made in caesars heart  crying long live hail caesar  antony  the posture of your blows are yet unknown  but for your words they rob the hybla bees  and leave them honeyless  not stingless too  o yes and soundless too  for you have stoln their buzzing antony  and very wisely threat before you sting  villains you did not so when your vile daggers  hackd one another in the sides of caesar  you showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds  and bowd like bondmen kissing caesars feet  whilst damned casca like a cur behind  struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers  flatterers now brutus thank yourself  this tongue had not offended so today  if cassius might have ruled  come come the cause if arguing make us sweat  the proof of it will turn to redder drops look  i draw a sword against conspirators  when think you that the sword goes up again  never till caesars three and thirty wounds  be well avenged or till another caesar  have added slaughter to the sword of traitors  caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands  unless thou bringst them with thee  so i hope  i was not born to die on brutus sword  o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain  young man thou couldst not die more honourable  a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour  joind with a masker and a reveller  old cassius still  come antony away  defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth  if you dare fight today come to the field  if not when you have stomachs  exeunt octavius antony and their army  why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark  the storm is up and all is on the hazard  ho lucilius hark a word with you  standing forthmy lord  brutus and lucilius converse apart  messala  standing forth  what says my general  messala  this is my birthday as this very day  was cassius born give me thy hand messala  be thou my witness that against my will  as pompey was am i compelld to set  upon one battle all our liberties  you know that i held epicurus strong  and his opinion now i change my mind  and partly credit things that do presage  coming from sardis on our former ensign  two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd  gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands  who to philippi here consorted us  this morning are they fled away and gone  and in their steads do ravens crows and kites  fly oer our heads and downward look on us  as we were sickly prey their shadows seem  a canopy most fatal under which  our army lies ready to give up the ghost  believe not so  i but believe it partly  for i am fresh of spirit and resolved  to meet all perils very constantly  even so lucilius  now most noble brutus  the gods today stand friendly that we may  lovers in peace lead on our days to age  but since the affairs of men rest still incertain  lets reason with the worst that may befall  if we do lose this battle then is this  the very last time we shall speak together  what are you then determined to do  even by the rule of that philosophy  by which i did blame cato for the death  which he did give himself i know not how  but i do find it cowardly and vile  for fear of what might fall so to prevent  the time of life arming myself with patience  to stay the providence of some high powers  that govern us below  then if we lose this battle  you are contented to be led in triumph  thorough the streets of rome  no cassius no think not thou noble roman  that ever brutus will go bound to rome  he bears too great a mind but this same day  must end that work the ides of march begun  and whether we shall meet again i know not  therefore our everlasting farewell take  for ever and for ever farewell cassius  if we do meet again why we shall smile  if not why then this parting was well made  for ever and for ever farewell brutus  if we do meet again well smile indeed  if not tis true this parting was well made  why then lead on o

post enter to him bernardo  whos there  nay answer me stand and unfold yourself  long live the king  bernardo  he  you come most carefully upon your hour  tis now struck twelve get thee to bed francisco  for this relief much thanks tis bitter cold  and i am sick at heart  have you had quiet guard  not a mouse stirring  well good night  if you do meet horatio and marcellus  the rivals of my watch bid them make haste  i think i hear them stand ho whos there  enter horatio and marcellus  friends to this ground  and liegemen to the dane  give you good night  o farewell honest soldier  who hath relieved you  bernardo has my place  give you good night  exit  holla bernardo  say  what is horatio there  a piece of him  welcome horatio welcome good marcellus  what has this thing appeard again tonight  i have seen nothing  horatio says tis but our fantasy  and will not let belief take hold of him  touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us  therefore i have entreated him along  with us to watch the minutes of this night  that if again this apparition come  he may approve our eyes and speak to it  tush tush twill not appear  sit down awhile  and let us once again assail your ears  that are so fortified against our story  what we have two nights seen  well sit we down  and let us hear bernardo speak of this  last night of all  when yond same star thats westward from the pole  had made his course to illume that part of heaven  where now it burns marcellus and myself  the bell then beating one  enter ghost  peace break thee off look where it comes again  in the same figure like the king thats dead  thou art a scholar speak to it horatio  looks it not like the king  mark it horatio  most like it harrows me with fear and wonder  it would be spoke to  question it horatio  what art thou that usurpst this time of night  together with that fair and warlike form  in which the majesty of buried denmark  did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak  it is offended  see it stalks away  stay speak speak i charge thee speak  exit ghost  tis gone and will not answer  how now horatio you tremble and look pale  is not this something more than fantasy  what think you ont  before my god i might not this believe  without the sensible and true avouch  of mine own eyes  is it not like the king  as thou art to thyself  such was the very armour he had on  when he the ambitious norway combated  so frownd he once when in an angry parle  he smote the sledded polacks on the ice  tis strange  thus twice before and jump at this dead hour  with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch  in what particular thought to work i know not  but in the gross and scope of my opinion  this bodes some strange eruption to our state  good now sit down and tell me he that knows  why this same strict and most observant watch  so nightly toils the subject of the land  and why such daily cast of brazen cannon  and foreign mart for implements of war  why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task  does not divide the sunday from the week  what might be toward that this sweaty haste  doth make the night jointlabourer with the day  who ist that can inform me  that can i  at least the whisper goes so our last king  whose image even but now appeard to us  was as you know by fortinbras of norway  thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride  dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet  for so this side of our known world esteemd him  did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact  well ratified by law and heraldry  did forfeit with his life all those his lands  which he stood seized of to the conqueror  against the which a moiety competent  was gaged by our king which had returnd  to the inheritance of fortinbras  had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant  and carriage of the article designd  his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras  of unimproved mettle hot and full  hath in the skirts of norway here and there  sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes  for food and diet to some enterprise  that hath a stomach int which is no other  as it doth well appear unto our state  but to recover of us by strong hand  and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands  so by his father lost and this i take it  is the main motive of our preparations  the source of this our watch and the chief head  of this posthaste and romage in the land  i think it be no other but een so  well may it sort that this portentous figure  comes armed through our watch so like the king  that was and is the question of these wars  a mote it is to trouble the minds eye  in the most high and palmy state of rome  a little ere the mightiest julius fell  the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead  did squeak and gibber in the roman streets  as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood  disasters in the sun and the moist star  upon whose influence neptunes empire stands  was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse  and even the like precurse of fierce events  as harbingers preceding still the fates  and prologue to the omen coming on  have heaven and earth together demonstrated  unto our climatures and countrymen  but soft behold lo where it comes again  reenter ghost  ill cross it though it blast me stay illusion  if thou hast any sound or use of voice  speak to me  if there be any good thing to be done  that may to thee do ease and grace to me  speak to me  cock crows  if thou art privy to thy countrys fate  which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak  or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life  extorted treasure in the womb of earth  for which they say you spirits oft walk in death  speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus  shall i strike at it with my partisan  do if it will not stand  tis here  tis here  tis gone  exit ghost  we do it wrong being so majestical  to offer it the show of violence  for it is as the air invulnerable  and our vain blows malicious mockery  it was about to speak when the cock crew  and then it started like a guilty thing  upon a fearful summons i have heard  the cock that is the trumpet to the morn  doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat  awake the god of day and at his warning  whether in sea or fire in earth or air  the extravagant and erring spirit hies  to his confine and of the truth herein  this present object made probation  it faded on the crowing of the cock  some say that ever gainst that season comes  wherein our saviours birth is celebrated  the bird of dawning singeth all night long  and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad  the nights are wholesome then no planets strike  no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm  so hallowd and so gracious is the time  so have i heard and do in part believe it  but look the morn in russet mantle clad  walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill  break we our watch up and by my advice  let us impart what we have seen tonight  unto young hamlet for upon my life  this spirit dumb to us will speak to him  do you consent we shall acquaint him with it  as needful in our loves fitting our duty  lets dot i pray and i this morning know  where we shall find him most conveniently  exeunt  scene ii a room of state in the castle  enter king claudius queen gertrude hamlet  polonius laertes voltimand cornelius lords and attendants  though yet of hamlet our dear brothers death  the memory be green and that it us befitted  to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom  to be contracted in one brow of woe  yet so far hath discretion fought with nature  that we with wisest sorrow think on him  together with remembrance of ourselves  therefore our sometime sister now our queen  the imperial jointress to this warlike state  have we as twere with a defeated joy  with an auspicious and a dropping eye  with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage  in equal scale weighing delight and dole  taken to wife nor have we herein barrd  your better wisdoms which have freely gone  with this affair along for all our thanks  now follows that you know young fortinbras  holding a weak supposal of our worth  or thinking by our late dear brothers death  our state to be disjoint and out of frame  colleagued with the dream of his advantage  he hath not faild to pester us with message  importing the surrender of those lands  lost by his father with all bonds of law  to our most valiant brother so much for him  now for ourself and for this time of meeting  thus much the business is we have here writ  to norway uncle of young fortinbras  who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears  of this his nephews purposeto suppress  his further gait herein in that the levies  the lists and full proportions are all made  out of his subject and we here dispatch  you good cornelius and you voltimand  for bearers of this greeting to old norway  giving to you no further personal power  to business with the king more than the scope  of these delated articles allow  farewell and let your haste commend your duty  in that and all things will we show our duty  we doubt it nothing heartily farewell  exeunt voltimand and cornelius  and now laertes whats the news with you  you told us of some suit what ist laertes  you cannot speak of reason to the dane  and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes  that shall not be my offer not thy asking  the head is not more native to the heart  the hand more instrumental to the mouth  than is the throne of denmark to thy father  what wouldst thou have laertes  my dread lord  your leave and favour to return to france  from whence though willingly i came to denmark  to show my duty in your coronation  yet now i must confess that duty done  my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france  and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon  have you your fathers leave what says polonius  he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave  by laboursome petition and at last  upon his will i seald my hard consent  i do beseech you give him leave to go  take thy fair hour laertes time be thine  and thy best graces spend it at thy will  but now my cousin hamlet and my son  aside  a little more than kin and less than kind  how is it that the clouds still hang on you  not so my lord i am too much i the sun  good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off  and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark  do not for ever with thy vailed lids  seek for thy noble father in the dust  thou knowst tis common all that lives must die  passing through nature to eternity  ay madam it is common  if it be  why seems it so particular with thee  seems madam nay it is i know not seems  tis not alone my inky cloak good mother  nor customary suits of solemn black  nor windy suspiration of forced breath  no nor the fruitful river in the eye  nor the dejected havior of the visage  together with all forms moods shapes of grief  that can denote me truly these indeed seem  for they are actions that a man might play  but i have that within which passeth show  these but the trappings and the suits of woe  tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet  to give these mourning duties to your father  but you must know your father lost a father  that father lost lost his and the survivor bound  in filial obligation for some term  to do obsequious sorrow but to persever  in obstinate condolement is a course  of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief  it shows a will most incorrect to heaven  a heart unfortified a mind impatient  an understanding simple and unschoold  for what we know must be and is as common  as any the most vulgar thing to sense  why should we in our peevish opposition  take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven  a fault against the dead a fault to nature  to reason most absurd whose common theme  is death of fathers and who still hath cried  from the first corse till he that died today  this must be so we pray you throw to earth  this unprevailing woe and think of us  as of a father for let the world take note  you are the most immediate to our throne  and with no less nobility of love  than that which dearest father bears his son  do i impart toward you for your intent  in going back to school in wittenberg  it is most retrograde to our desire  and we beseech you bend you to remain  here in the cheer and comfort of our eye  our chiefest courtier cousin and our son  let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet  i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg  i shall in all my best obey you madam  why tis a loving and a fair reply  be as ourself in denmark madam come  this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet  sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof  no jocund health that denmark drinks today  but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell  and the kings rouse the heavens all bruit again  respeaking earthly thunder come away  exeunt all but hamlet  o that this too too solid flesh would melt  thaw and resolve itself into a dew  or that the everlasting had not fixd  his canon gainst selfslaughter o god god  how weary stale flat and unprofitable  seem to me all the uses of this world  fie ont ah fie tis an unweeded garden  that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature  possess it merely that it should come to this  but two months dead nay not so much not two  so excellent a king that was to this  hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother  that he might not beteem the winds of heaven  visit her face too roughly heaven and earth  must i remember why she would hang on him  as if increase of appetite had grown  by what it fed on and yet within a month  let me not think ontfrailty thy name is woman  a little month or ere those shoes were old  with which she followd my poor fathers body  like niobe all tearswhy she even she  o god a beast that wants discourse of reason  would have mournd longermarried with my uncle  my fathers brother but no more like my father  than i to hercules within a month  ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears  had left the flushing in her galled eyes  she married o most wicked speed to post  with such dexterity to incestuous sheets  it is not nor it cannot come to good  but break my heart for i must hold my tongue  enter horatio marcellus and bernardo  hail to your lordship  i am glad to see you well  horatioor i do forget myself  the same my lord and your poor servant ever  sir my good friend ill change that name with you  and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus  my good lord  i am very glad to see you good even sir  but what in faith make you from wittenberg  a truant disposition good my lord  i would not hear your enemy say so  nor shall you do mine ear that violence  to make it truster of your own report  against yourself i know you are no truant  but what is your affair in elsinore  well teach you to drink deep ere you depart  my lord i came to see your fathers funeral  i pray thee do not mock me fellowstudent  i think it was to see my mothers wedding  indeed my lord it followd hard upon  thrift thrift horatio the funeral baked meats  did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables  would i had met my dearest foe in heaven  or ever i had seen that day horatio  my fathermethinks i see my father  where my lord  in my minds eye horatio  i saw him once he was a goodly king  he was a man take him for all in all  i shall not look upon his like again  my lord i think i saw him yesternight  saw who  my lord the king your father  the king my father  season your admiration for awhile  with an attent ear till i may deliver  upon the witness of these gentlemen  this marvel to you  for gods love let me hear  two nights together had these gentlemen  marcellus and bernardo on their watch  in the dead vast and middle of the night  been thus encounterd a figure like your father  armed at point exactly capape  appears before them and with solemn march  goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd  by their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes  within his truncheons length whilst they distilled  almost to jelly with the act of fear  stand dumb and speak not to him this to me  in dreadful secrecy impart they did  and i with them the third night kept the watch  where as they had deliverd both in time  form of the thing each word made true and good  the apparition comes i knew your father  these hands are not more like  but where was this  my lord upon the platform where we watchd  did you not speak to it  my lord i did  but answer made it none yet once methought  it lifted up its head and did address  itself to motion like as it would speak  but even then the morning cock crew loud  and at the sound it shrunk in haste away  and vanishd from our sight  tis very strange  as i do live my honourd lord tis true  and we did think it writ down in our duty  to let you know of it  indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me  hold you the watch tonight  we do my lord  armd say you  armd my lord  from top to toe  my lord from head to foot  then saw you not his face  o yes my lord he wore his beaver up  what lookd he frowningly  a countenance more in sorrow than in anger  pale or red  nay very pale  and fixd his eyes upon you  most constantly  i would i had been there  it would have much amazed you  very like very like stayd it long  while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred  longer longer  not when i sawt  his beard was grizzledno  it was as i have seen it in his life  a sable silverd  i will watch tonight  perchance twill walk again  i warrant it will  if it assume my noble fathers person  ill speak to it though hell itself should gape  and bid me hold my peace i pray you all  if you have hitherto conceald this sight  let it be tenable in your silence still  and whatsoever else shall hap tonight  give it an understanding but no tongue  i will requite your loves so fare you well  upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve  ill visit you  our duty to your honour  your loves as mine to you farewell  exeunt all but hamlet  my fathers spirit in arms all is not well  i doubt some foul play would the night were come  till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise  though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes  exit  scene iii a room in polonius house  enter laertes and ophelia  my necessaries are embarkd farewell  and sister as the winds give benefit  and convoy is assistant do not sleep  but let me hear from you  do you doubt that  for hamlet and the trifling of his favour  hold it a fashion and a toy in blood  a violet in the youth of primy nature  forward not permanent sweet not lasting  the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more  no more but so  think it no more  for nature crescent does not grow alone  in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes  the inward service of the mind and soul  grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now  and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch  the virtue of his will but you must fear  his greatness weighd his will is not his own  for he himself is subject to his birth  he may not as unvalued persons do  carve for himself for on his choice depends  the safety and health of this whole state  and therefore must his choice be circumscribed  unto the voice and yielding of that body  whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you  it fits your wisdom so far to believe it  as he in his particular act and place  may give his saying deed which is no further  than the main voice of denmark goes withal  then weigh what loss your honour may sustain  if with too credent ear you list his songs  or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open  to his unmasterd importunity  fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister  and keep you in the rear of your affection  out of the shot and danger of desire  the chariest maid is prodigal enough  if she unmask her beauty to the moon  virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes  the canker galls the infants of the spring  too oft before their buttons be disclosed  and in the morn and liquid dew of youth  contagious blastments are most imminent  be wary then best safety lies in fear  youth to itself rebels though none else near  i shall the effect of this good lesson keep  as watchman to my heart but good my brother  do not as some ungracious pastors do  show me the steep and thorny way to heaven  whiles like a puffd and reckless libertine  himself the primrose path of dalliance treads  and recks not his own rede  o fear me not  i stay too long but here my father comes  enter polonius  a double blessing is a double grace  occasion smiles upon a second leave  yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame  the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail  and you are stayd for there my blessing with thee  and these few precepts in thy memory  see thou character give thy thoughts no tongue  nor any unproportioned thought his act  be thou familiar but by no means vulgar  those friends thou hast and their adoption tried  grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel  but do not dull thy palm with entertainment  of each newhatchd unfledged comrade beware  of entrance to a quarrel but being in  beart that the opposed may beware of thee  give every man thy ear but few thy voice  take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment  costly thy habit as thy purse can buy  but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy  for the apparel oft proclaims the man  and they in france of the best rank and station  are of a most select and generous chief in that  neither a borrower nor a lender be  for loan oft loses both itself and friend  and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry  this above all to thine ownself be true  and it must follow as the night the day  thou canst not then be false to any man  farewell my blessing season this in thee  most humbly do i take my leave my lord  the time invites you go your servants tend  farewell ophelia and remember well  what i have said to you  tis in my memory lockd  and you yourself shall keep the key of it  farewell  exit  what ist ophelia be hath said to you  so please you something touching the lord hamlet  marry well bethought  tis told me he hath very oft of late  given private time to you and you yourself  have of your audience been most free and bounteous  if it be so as so tis put on me  and that in way of caution i must tell you  you do not understand yourself so clearly  as it behoves my daughter and your honour  what is between you give me up the truth  he hath my lord of late made many tenders  of his affection to me  affection pooh you speak like a green girl  unsifted in such perilous circumstance  do you believe his tenders as you call them  i do not know my lord what i should think  marry ill teach you think yourself a baby  that you have taen these tenders for true pay  which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly  ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase  running it thusyoull tender me a fool  my lord he hath importuned me with love  in honourable fashion  ay fashion you may call it go to go to  and hath given countenance to his speech my lord  with almost all the holy vows of heaven  ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know  when the blood burns how prodigal the soul  lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter  giving more light than heat extinct in both  even in their promise as it is amaking  you must not take for fire from this time  be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence  set your entreatments at a higher rate  than a command to parley for lord hamlet  believe so much in him that he is young  and with a larger tether may he walk  than may be given you in few ophelia  do not believe his vows for they are brokers  not of that dye which their investments show  but mere implorators of unholy suits  breathing like sanctified and pious bawds  the better to beguile this is for all  i would not in plain terms from this time forth  have you so slander any moment leisure  as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet  look tot i charge you come your ways  i shall obey my lord  exeunt  scene iv the platform  enter hamlet horatio and marcellus  the air bites shrewdly it is very cold  it is a nipping and an eager air  what hour now  i think it lacks of twelve  no it is struck  indeed i heard it not then it draws near the season  wherein the spirit held his wont to walk  a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within  what does this mean my lord  the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse  keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels  and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down  the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out  the triumph of his pledge  is it a custom  ay marry ist  but to my mind though i am native here  and to the manner born it is a custom  more honourd in the breach than the observance  this heavyheaded revel east and west  makes us traduced and taxd of other nations  they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase  soil our addition and indeed it takes  from our achievements though performd at height  the pith and marrow of our attribute  so oft it chances in particular men  that for some vicious mole of nature in them  as in their birthwherein they are not guilty  since nature cannot choose his origin  by the oergrowth of some complexion  oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason  or by some habit that too much oerleavens  the form of plausive manners that these men  carrying i say the stamp of one defect  being natures livery or fortunes star  their virtues elsebe they as pure as grace  as infinite as man may undergo  shall in the general censure take corruption  from that particular fault the dram of eale  doth all the noble substance of a doubt  to his own scandal  look my lord it comes  enter ghost  angels and ministers of grace defend us  be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd  bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell  be thy intents wicked or charitable  thou comest in such a questionable shape  that i will speak to thee ill call thee hamlet  king father royal dane o answer me  let me not burst in ignorance but tell  why thy canonized bones hearsed in death  have burst their cerements why the sepulchre  wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd  hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws  to cast thee up again what may this mean  that thou dead corse again in complete steel  revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon  making night hideous and we fools of nature  so horridly to shake our disposition  with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls  say why is this wherefore what should we do  ghost beckons hamlet  it beckons you to go away with it  as if it some impartment did desire  to you alone  look with what courteous action  it waves you to a more removed ground  but do not go with it  no by no means  it will not speak then i will follow it  do not my lord  why what should be the fear  i do not set my life in a pins fee  and for my soul what can it do to that  being a thing immortal as itself  it waves me forth again ill follow it  what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord  or to the dreadful summit of the cliff  that beetles oer his base into the sea  and there assume some other horrible form  which might deprive your sovereignty of reason  and draw you into madness think of it  the very place puts toys of desperation  without more motive into every brain  that looks so many fathoms to the sea  and hears it roar beneath  it waves me still  go on ill follow thee  you shall not go my lord  hold off your hands  be ruled you shall not go  my fate cries out  and makes each petty artery in this body  as hardy as the nemean lions nerve  still am i calld unhand me gentlemen  by heaven ill make a ghost of him that lets me  i say away go on ill follow thee  exeunt ghost and hamlet  he waxes desperate with imagination  lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him  have after to what issue will this come  something is rotten in the state of denmark  heaven will direct it  nay lets follow him  exeunt  scene v another part of the platform  enter ghost and hamlet  where wilt thou lead me speak ill go no further  mark me  i will  my hour is almost come  when i to sulphurous and tormenting flames  must render up myself  alas poor ghost  pity me not but lend thy serious hearing  to what i shall unfold  speak i am bound to hear  so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear  what  i am thy fathers spirit  doomd for a certain term to walk the night  and for the day confined to fast in fires  till the foul crimes done in my days of nature  are burnt and purged away but that i am forbid  to tell the secrets of my prisonhouse  i could a tale unfold whose lightest word  would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood  make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres  thy knotted and combined locks to part  and each particular hair to stand on end  like quills upon the fretful porpentine  but this eternal blazon must not be  to ears of flesh and blood list list o list  if thou didst ever thy dear father love  o god  revenge his foul and most unnatural murder  murder  murder most foul as in the best it is  but this most foul strange and unnatural  haste me to knowt that i with wings as swift  as meditation or the thoughts of love  may sweep to my revenge  i find thee apt  and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf  wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear  tis given out that sleeping in my orchard  a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark  is by a forged process of my death  rankly abused but know thou noble youth  the serpent that did sting thy fathers life  now wears his crown  o my prophetic soul my uncle  ay that incestuous that adulterate beast  with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts  o wicked wit and gifts that have the power  so to seducewon to his shameful lust  the will of my most seemingvirtuous queen  o hamlet what a fallingoff was there  from me whose love was of that dignity  that it went hand in hand even with the vow  i made to her in marriage and to decline  upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  to those of mine  but virtue as it never will be moved  though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven  so lust though to a radiant angel linkd  will sate itself in a celestial bed  and prey on garbage  but soft methinks i scent the morning air  brief let me be sleeping within my orchard  my custom always of the afternoon  upon my secure hour thy uncle stole  with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial  and in the porches of my ears did pour  the leperous distilment whose effect  holds such an enmity with blood of man  that swift as quicksilver it courses through  the natural gates and alleys of the body  and with a sudden vigour doth posset  and curd like eager droppings into milk  the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine  and a most instant tetter barkd about  most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust  all my smooth body  thus was i sleeping by a brothers hand  of life of crown of queen at once dispatchd  cut off even in the blossoms of my sin  unhouseld disappointed unaneld  no reckoning made but sent to my account  with all my imperfections on my head  o horrible o horrible most horrible  if thou hast nature in thee bear it not  let not the royal bed of denmark be  a couch for luxury and damned incest  but howsoever thou pursuest this act  taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive  against thy mother aught leave her to heaven  and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge  to prick and sting her fare thee well at once  the glowworm shows the matin to be near  and gins to pale his uneffectual fire  adieu adieu hamlet remember me  exit  o all you host of heaven o

drinking fencing swearing quarrelling  drabbing you may go so far  my lord that would dishonour him  faith no as you may season it in the charge  you must not put another scandal on him  that he is open to incontinency  thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly  that they may seem the taints of liberty  the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind  a savageness in unreclaimed blood  of general assault  but my good lord  wherefore should you do this  ay my lord  i would know that  marry sir heres my drift  and i believe it is a fetch of wit  you laying these slight sullies on my son

the name of god  my lord as i was sewing in my closet  lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced  no hat upon his head his stockings fould  ungarterd and downgyved to his ancle  pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other  and with a look so piteous in purport  as if he had been loosed out of hell  to speak of horrorshe comes before me  mad for thy love  my lord i do not know  but truly i do fear it  what said he  he took me by the wrist and held me hard  then goes he to the length of all his arm  and with his other hand thus oer his brow  he falls to such perusal of my face  as he would draw it long stayd he so  at last a little shaking of mine arm  and thrice his head thus waving up and down  he raised a sigh so piteous and profound  as it did seem to shatter all his bulk  and end his being that done he lets me go  and with his head over his shoulder turnd  he seemd to find his way without his eyes  for out o doors he went without their helps  and to the last bended their light on me  come go with me i will go seek the king  this is the very ecstasy of love  whose violent property fordoes itself  and leads the will to desperate undertakings  as oft as any passion under heaven  that does afflict our natures i am sorry  what have you given him any hard words of late  no my good lord but as you did command  i did repel his fetters and denied  his access to me  that hath made him mad  i am sorry that with better heed and judgment  i had not quoted him i feard he did but trifle  and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy  by heaven it is as proper to our age  to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions  as it is common for the younger sort  to lack discretion come go we to the king  this must be known which being kept close might  move  more grief to hide

up with him  and sith so neighbourd to his youth and havior  that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court  some little time so by your companies  to draw him on to pleasures and to gather  so much

received his love  what do you think of me  as of a man faithful and honourable  i would fain prove so but what might you think  when i had seen this hot love on the wing  as i perceived it i must tell you that  before my daughter told mewhat might you  or my dear majesty your queen here think  if i had playd the desk or tablebook  or given my heart a winking mute and dumb  or lookd upon this love with idle sight  what might you think no i went round to work  and my young mistress thus i did bespeak  lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star  this must not be and then i precepts gave her  that she should lock herself from his resort  admit no messengers receive no tokens  which done she took the fruits of my advice  and he repulseda short tale to make  fell into a sadness then into a

that still harping on my  daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i  was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and  truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for  love very near this ill speak to him again  what do you read my lord  words words words  what is the matter my lord  between who  i mean the matter that you read my lord  slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here  that old men have grey beards that their faces are  wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and  plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of  wit together with most weak hams all which sir  though i most powerfully and potently believe yet  i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for  yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab  you could go backward  aside  though this be madness yet there is method  in t will you walk out of the air my lord  into my grave  indeed that is out o the air  aside  how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness  that often madness hits on which reason and sanity  could not so prosperously be delivered of i will  leave him and suddenly contrive the means of  meeting between him and my daughtermy honourable  lord i will most humbly take my leave of you  you cannot sir take from me any thing that i will  more willingly part withal except my life except  my life except my life  fare you well my lord  these tedious old fools  enter

guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both  as the indifferent children of the earth  happy in that we are not overhappy  on fortunes cap we are not the very button  nor the soles of her shoe  neither my lord  then you live about her waist or in the middle of  her favours  faith her privates we  in the secret parts of fortune o most true she  is a strumpet whats the news  none my lord but that the worlds grown honest  then is doomsday near but your news is not true  let me question more in particular what have you  my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune  that she sends you to prison hither  prison my lord  denmarks a prison  then is the world one  a goodly one in which there are many confines  wards and dungeons denmark being one o the worst  we think not so my lord  why then tis none to you for there is nothing  either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me  it is a prison  why then your ambition makes it one tis too  narrow for your mind  o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count  myself a king of infinite space were it not that i  have bad dreams  which dreams indeed are ambition for the very  substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream  a dream itself is but a shadow  truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a  quality that it is but a shadows shadow  then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and  outstretched heroes the beggars shadows shall we  to the court for by my fay i cannot reason  well wait upon you  no such matter i will not sort you with the rest  of my servants for to speak to you like an honest  man i am most dreadfully attended but in the  beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore  to visit you my lord no other occasion  beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i  thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are  too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it  your own inclining is it a free visitation come  deal justly with me come come nay speak  what should we say my lord  why any thing but to the purpose you were sent  for and there is a kind of confession in your looks  which your modesties have not craft enough to colour  i know the good king and queen have sent for you  to what end my lord  that you must teach me but let me conjure you by  the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of  our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved  love and by what more dear a better proposer could  charge you withal be even and direct with me  whether you were sent for or no  aside to guildenstern  what say you  aside  nay then i have an eye of youif you  love me hold not off  my lord we were sent for  i will tell you why so shall my anticipation  prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king  and queen moult no feather i have of latebut  wherefore i know notlost all my mirth forgone all  custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily  with my disposition that this goodly frame the  earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most  excellent canopy the air look you this brave  oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted  with golden fire why it appears no other thing to  me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours  what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason  how infinite in faculty in form and moving how  express and admirable in action how like an angel  in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the  world the paragon of animals and yet to me  what is this quintessence of dust man delights not  me no nor woman neither though by your smiling  you seem to say so  my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts  why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me  to think my lord if you delight not in man what  lenten entertainment the players shall receive from  you we coted them on the way and hither are they  coming to offer you service  he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty  shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight  shall use his foil and target the lover shall not  sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part  in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose  lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall  say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt  fort what players are they  even those you were wont to take delight in the  tragedians of the city  how chances it they travel their residence both  in reputation and profit was better both ways  i think their inhibition comes by the means of the  late innovation  do they hold the same estimation they did when i was  in the city are they so followed  no indeed are they not  how comes it do they grow rusty  nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but  there is sir an aery of children little eyases  that cry out on the top of question and are most  tyrannically clapped fort these are now the  fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they  call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of  goosequills and dare scarce come thither  what are they children who maintains em how are  they escoted will they pursue the quality no  longer than they can sing will they not say  afterwards if they should grow themselves to common  playersas it is most like if their means are no  bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them  exclaim against their own succession  faith there has been much to do on both sides and  the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to  controversy there was for a while no money bid  for argument unless the poet and the player went to  cuffs in the question  ist possible  o there has been much throwing about of brains  do the boys carry it away  ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too  it is not very strange for mine uncle is king of  denmark and those that would make mows at him while  my father lived give twenty forty fifty an  hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little  sblood there is something in this more than  natural if philosophy could find it out  flourish of trumpets within  there are the players  gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands  come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion  and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb  lest my extent to the players which i tell you  must show fairly

thee last  comest thou to beard me in denmark what my young  lady and mistress byr lady your ladyship is  nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the  altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like  apiece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the  ring masters you are all welcome well een  tot like french falconers fly at any thing we see  well have a speech straight come give us a taste  of your quality come a passionate speech  what speech my lord  i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was  never acted or if it was not above once for the  play i remember pleased not the million twas  caviare to the general but it wasas i received  it and others whose judgments in such matters  cried in the top of minean excellent play well  digested in the scenes set down with as much  modesty as cunning i remember one said there  were no sallets in the lines to make the matter  savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might  indict the author of affectation but called it an  honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very  much more handsome than fine one speech in it i  chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and  thereabout of it especially where he speaks of  priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin  at this line let me see let me see  the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast  it is not soit begins with pyrrhus  the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms  black as his purpose did the night resemble  when he lay couched in the ominous horse  hath now this dread and black complexion smeard  with heraldry more dismal head to foot  now is he total gules horridly trickd  with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons  baked and impasted with the parching streets  that lend a tyrannous and damned light  to their lords murder roasted in wrath and fire  and thus oersized with coagulate gore  with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus  old grandsire priam seeks  so proceed you  fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and  good discretion  anon he finds him  striking too short at greeks his antique sword  rebellious to his arm lies where it falls  repugnant to command unequal matchd  pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide  but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium  seeming to feel this blow with flaming top  stoops to his base and with a hideous crash  takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword  which was declining on the milky head  of reverend priam seemd i the air to stick  so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood  and like a neutral to his will and matter  did nothing  but as we often see against some storm  a silence in the heavens the rack stand still  the bold winds speechless and the orb below  as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder  doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause  aroused vengeance sets him new awork  and never did the cyclops hammers fall  on marss armour forged for proof eterne  with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword  now falls on priam  out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods  in general synod take away her power  break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel  and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven  as low as to the fiends  this is too long  it shall to the barbers with your beard prithee  say on hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he  sleeps say on come to hecuba  but who o who had seen the mobled queen  the mobled queen  thats good mobled queen is good  run barefoot up and down threatening the flames  with bisson rheum a clout upon that head  where late the diadem stood and for a robe  about her lank and all oerteemed loins  a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up  who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd  gainst fortunes state would treason have  pronounced  but if the gods themselves did see her then  when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport  in mincing with his sword her husbands limbs  the instant burst of clamour that she made  unless things mortal move them not at all  would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven  and passion in the gods  look whether he has not turned his colour and has  tears ins eyes pray you no more  tis well ill have thee speak out the rest soon  good my lord will you see the players well  bestowed do you hear let them be well used for  they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the  time after your death you were better have a bad  epitaph than their ill report while you live  my lord i will use them according to their desert  gods bodykins man much better use every man  after his desert and who should scape whipping  use them after your own honour and dignity the less  they deserve the more merit is in your bounty  take them in  come sirs  follow him friends well hear a play tomorrow  exit polonius with all the players but the first  dost thou hear me old friend can you play the  murder of gonzago  ay my lord  well hat tomorrow night you could for a need  study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which  i would set down and insert int could you not  ay my lord  very well follow that lord and look you mock him  not  exit first player  my good friends ill leave you till night you are  welcome to elsinore  good my lord  ay so god be wi ye  exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern  now i am alone  o what a rogue and peasant slave am i  is it not monstrous that this player here  but in a fiction in a dream of passion  could force his soul so to his own conceit  that from her working all his visage wannd  tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect  a broken voice and his whole function suiting  with forms to his conceit and all for nothing  for hecuba  whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba  that he should weep for her what would he do  had he the motive and the cue for passion  that i have he would drown the stage with tears  and cleave the general ear with horrid speech  make mad the guilty and appal the free  confound the ignorant and amaze indeed  the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i  a dull and muddymettled rascal peak  like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause  and can say nothing no not for a king  upon whose property and most dear life  a damnd defeat was made am i a coward  who calls me villain breaks my pate across  plucks off my beard and blows it in my face  tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat  as deep as to the lungs who does me this  ha  swounds i should take it for it cannot be  but i am pigeonliverd and lack gall  to make oppression bitter or ere this  i should have fatted all the region kites  with this slaves offal bloody bawdy villain  remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain  o vengeance  why what an ass am i this is most brave  that i the son of a dear father murderd  prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell  must like a whore unpack my heart with words  and fall acursing like a very drab  a scullion  fie upont foh about my brain i have heard  that guilty creatures sitting at a play  have by the very cunning of the scene  been struck so to the soul that presently  they have proclaimd their malefactions  for murder though it have no tongue will speak  with most miraculous organ ill have these players  play something like the murder of my father  before mine uncle ill observe his looks  ill tent him to the quick if he but blench  i know my course the spirit that i have seen  may be the devil and the devil hath power  to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps  out of my weakness and my melancholy  as he is very potent with such spirits  abuses me to damn me ill have grounds  more relative than this the play s the thing  wherein ill catch the conscience of the king      act iii  scene i a room in the castle  enter king claudius queen gertrude polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern  and can you by no drift of circumstance  get from him why he puts on this confusion  grating so harshly all his days of quiet  with turbulent and dangerous lunacy  he does confess he feels himself distracted  but from what cause he will by no means speak  nor do we find him forward to be sounded  but with a crafty madness keeps aloof  when we would bring him on to some confession  of his true state  did he receive you well  most like a gentleman  but with much forcing of his disposition  niggard of question but of our demands  most free in his reply  did you assay him  to any pastime  madam it so fell out that certain players  we oerraught on the way of these we told him  and there did seem in him a kind of joy  to hear of it they are about the court  and as i think they have already order  this night to play before him  tis most true  and he beseechd me to entreat your majesties  to hear and see the matter  with all my heart and it doth much content me  to hear him so inclined  good gentlemen give him a further edge  and drive his purpose on to these delights  we shall my lord  exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern  sweet gertrude leave us too  for we have closely sent for hamlet hither  that he

ourselves  to ophelia  read on this book  that show of such an exercise may colour  your loneliness we are oft to blame in this  tis too much provedthat with devotions visage  and pious action we do

whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer  the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune  or to take arms against a sea of troubles  and by opposing end them to die to sleep  no more and by a sleep to say we end  the heartache and the thousand natural shocks  that flesh is heir to tis a consummation  devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep  to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub  for in that sleep of death what dreams may come  when we have shuffled off this mortal coil  must give us pause theres the respect  that makes calamity of so long life  for who would bear the whips and scorns of time  the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely  the pangs of despised love the laws delay  the insolence of office and the spurns  that patient merit of the unworthy takes  when he himself might his quietus make  with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear  to grunt and sweat under a weary life  but that the dread of something after death  the undiscoverd country from whose bourn  no traveller returns puzzles the will  and makes us rather bear those ills we have  than fly to others that we know not of  thus conscience does make cowards of us all  and thus the native hue of resolution  is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought  and enterprises of great pith and moment  with this regard their currents turn awry  and lose the name of actionsoft you now  the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons  be all my sins rememberd  good my lord  how does your honour for this many a day  i humbly thank you well well well  my lord i have remembrances of yours  that i have longed long to redeliver

and fair your honesty should  admit no discourse to your beauty  could beauty my lord have better commerce than  with honesty  ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner  transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the  force of honesty can translate beauty into his  likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the  time gives it proof i did love you once  indeed my lord you made me believe so  you should not have believed me for virtue cannot  so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of  it i loved you not  i was the more deceived  get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a

for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say  the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget  a temperance that may give it smoothness o it  offends me to the soul to hear a robustious  periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to  very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who  for the most part are capable of nothing but  inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such

journeymen had made men and not made them  well they imitated humanity so abominably  i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us  sir  o reform it altogether and let those that play  your

 for womens fear and love holds quantity  in neither aught or in extremity  now what my love is proof hath made you know  and as my love is sized my fear is so  where love is great the littlest doubts are fear  where little fears grow great great love grows there  faith i must leave thee love and shortly too  my operant powers their functions leave to do  and thou shalt live in this fair world behind  honourd beloved and haply one as kind  for husband shalt thou  o confound the rest  such love must needs be treason in my breast  in second husband let me be accurst  none wed the second but who killd the first  aside  wormwood wormwood  the instances that second marriage move  are base respects of thrift but none of love  a second time i kill my husband dead  when second husband kisses me in bed  i do believe you think what now you speak  but what we do determine oft we break  purpose is but the slave to memory  of violent birth but poor validity  which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree  but fall unshaken when they mellow be  most necessary tis that we forget  to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt  what to ourselves in passion we propose  the passion ending doth the purpose lose  the violence of either grief or joy  their own enactures with themselves destroy  where joy most revels grief doth most lament  grief joys joy grieves on slender accident  this world is not for aye nor tis not strange  that even our loves should with our fortunes change  for tis a question left us yet to prove  whether love lead fortune or else fortune love  the great man down you mark his favourite flies  the poor advanced makes friends of enemies  and hitherto doth love on fortune tend  for who not needs shall never lack a friend  and who in want a hollow friend doth try  directly seasons him his enemy  but orderly to end where i begun  our wills and fates do so contrary run  that our devices still are overthrown  our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own  so

and with a knowing ear  that he which hath your noble father slain  pursued my life  it well appears but tell me  why you proceeded not against these feats  so crimeful and so capital in nature  as by your safety wisdom all things else  you mainly were stirrd up  o for two special reasons  which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd  but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother  lives almost by his looks and for myself  my virtue or my plague be it either which  shes so conjunctive to my life and soul  that as the star moves not but in his sphere  i could not but by her the other motive  why to a public count i might not go  is the great love the general gender bear him  who dipping all his faults in their affection  would like the spring that turneth wood to stone  convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows  too slightly timberd for so loud a wind  would have reverted to my bow again  and not where i had aimd them  and so have i a noble father lost  a sister driven into desperate terms  whose worth if praises may go back again  stood challenger on mount of all the age  for her perfections but my revenge will come  break not your sleeps for that you must not think

kingdom tomorrow shall i beg leave to see  your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your  pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden  and more strange return                  hamlet  what should this mean are all the rest come back  or is it some abuse and no such thing  know you the hand  tis hamlets character naked  and in a postscript here he says alone  can you advise me  im lost in it my lord but let him come  it warms the very sickness in my heart  that i shall live and tell him to his teeth  thus didest thou  if it be so laertes  as how should it be so how otherwise  will you be ruled by me  ay my lord  so you will not oerrule me to a peace  to thine own peace if he be now returnd  as checking at his voyage and that he means  no more to undertake it i will work him  to an exploit now ripe in my device  under the which he shall not choose but fall  and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe  but even his mother shall uncharge the practise  and call it accident  my lord i will be ruled  the rather if you could devise it so  that i might be the organ  it falls right  you have been talkd of since your travel much  and that in hamlets hearing for a quality  wherein they say you shine your sum of parts  did not together pluck such envy from him  as did that one and that in my regard  of the unworthiest siege  what part is that my lord  a very riband in the cap of youth  yet needful too for youth no less becomes  the light and careless livery that it wears  than settled age his sables and his weeds  importing health and graveness two months since  here was a gentleman of normandy  ive seen myself and served against the french  and they can well on horseback but this gallant  had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat  and to such wondrous doing brought his horse  as he had been incorpsed and deminatured  with the brave beast so far he toppd my thought  that i in forgery of shapes and tricks  come short of what he did  a norman wast  a norman  upon my life lamond  the very same  i know him well he is the brooch indeed  and gem of all the nation  he made confession of you  and gave you such a masterly report  for art and exercise in your defence  and for your rapier most especially  that he cried out twould be a sight indeed  if one could match you the scrimers of their nation  he swore had had neither motion guard nor eye  if you opposed them sir this report of his  did hamlet so envenom with his envy  that he could nothing do but wish and beg  your sudden coming oer to play with him  now out of this  what out of this my lord  laertes was your father dear to you  or are you like the painting of a sorrow  a face without a heart  why ask you this  not that i think you did not love your father  but that i know love is begun by time  and that i see in passages of proof  time qualifies the spark and fire of it  there lives within the very flame of love  a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it  and nothing is at a like goodness still  for goodness growing to a plurisy  dies in his own too much that we would do  we should do when we would for this would changes  and hath abatements and delays as many  as there are tongues are hands are accidents  and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh  that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer  hamlet comes back what would you undertake  to show yourself your fathers son in deed  more than in words  to cut his throat i the church  no place indeed should murder sanctuarize  revenge should have no bounds but good laertes  will you do this keep close within

wager on your heads he being remiss  most generous and free from all contriving  will not peruse the foils so that with ease  or with a little shuffling you may choose  a sword unbated and in a pass of practise  requite him for your father  i will dot  and for that purpose ill anoint my sword  i bought an unction of a mountebank  so mortal that but dip a knife in it  where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare  collected from all simples that have virtue  under the moon can save the thing from death  that is but scratchd withal ill touch my point  with this contagion that if i gall him slightly  it may be death  lets further think of this  weigh what convenience both of time and means  may fit us to our shape if this should fail  and that our drift look through our bad performance  twere better not assayd therefore this project  should have a back or second that might hold  if this should blast in proof soft let me see  well make a solemn wager on your cunnings i hat  when in

a bunghole  twere to consider too curiously to consider so  no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with  modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as  thus alexander died alexander was buried  alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of  earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he  was converted might they not stop a beerbarrel  imperious caesar dead and turnd to clay  might stop a hole to keep the wind away  o that that earth which kept the world in awe  should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw  but soft but soft aside here comes the king  enter priest  and c in procession the corpse of  ophelia laertes and mourners following king claudius queen gertrude their trains  and c  the queen the courtiers who is this they follow  and with such maimed rites this doth

mark  what ceremony else  her obsequies have been as far enlarged  as we have warrantise her death was doubtful  and but that great command oersways the order  she should in ground unsanctified have lodged  till the last trumpet for charitable prayers  shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her  yet here she is allowd her virgin crants  her maiden strewments and the bringing home  of bell and burial  must there no more be done  no more be done  we should profane the service of the dead  to sing a requiem and such rest to her  as to peaceparted souls  lay her i the earth  and from her

dead  till of this flat a mountain you have made  to oertop old pelion or the skyish head  of blue olympus  advancing     what is he whose grief  bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow  conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand  like wonderwounded hearers this is i  hamlet the dane  leaps into the grave  the devil take thy soul  grappling with him  thou prayst not well  i prithee take thy fingers from my throat  for though i am not splenitive and rash  yet have i something in me dangerous  which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand  pluck them asunder  hamlet hamlet  gentlemen  good my lord be quiet  the attendants part them and they come out of the grave  why i will fight with him upon this theme  until my eyelids will no longer wag  o my son what theme  i loved

as thou  this is mere madness  and thus awhile the fit will work on him  anon as patient as the female dove  when that her golden couplets are disclosed  his silence will sit drooping  hear you sir  what is the reason that you use me thus  i loved you ever but it is no matter  let hercules himself do what he may  the cat will mew and dog will have his day  exit  i pray you good horatio wait upon him  exit horatio  to laertes  strengthen your patience in our last nights speech  well put the matter to the present push  good gertrude set some watch over your son  this grave shall have a living monument  an hour of quiet shortly shall we see  till then in patience our proceeding be  exeunt  scene ii a hall in the castle  enter hamlet and horatio  so much for this sir now shall you see the other  you do remember all the circumstance  remember it my lord  sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting  that would not let me sleep methought i lay  worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly  and praised be rashness for it let us know  our indiscretion sometimes serves us well  when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us  theres a divinity that shapes our ends  roughhew them how we will  that is most certain  up from my cabin  my seagown scarfd about me in the dark  groped i to find out them had my desire  fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew  to mine own room again making so bold  my fears forgetting manners to unseal  their grand commission where i found horatio  o royal knaveryan exact command  larded with many several sorts of reasons  importing denmarks health and englands too  with ho such bugs and goblins in my life  that on the supervise no leisure bated  no not to stay the grinding of the axe  my head should be struck off  ist possible  heres the commission read it at more leisure  but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed  i beseech you  being thus benetted round with villanies  ere i could make a prologue to my brains  they had begun the playi sat me down  devised a new commission wrote it fair  i once did hold it as our statists do  a baseness to write fair and labourd much  how to forget that learning but sir now  it did me yeomans service wilt thou know  the effect of what i wrote  ay good my lord  an earnest conjuration from the king  as england was his faithful tributary  as love between them like the palm might flourish  as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear  and stand a comma tween their amities  and many suchlike ases of great charge  that on the view and knowing of these contents  without debatement further more or less  he should the bearers put to sudden death  not shrivingtime allowd  how was this seald  why even in that was heaven ordinant  i had my fathers signet in my purse  which was the model of that danish seal  folded the writ up in form of the other  subscribed it gavet the impression placed it safely  the changeling never known now the next day  was our seafight and what to this was sequent  thou knowst already  so guildenstern and rosencrantz go tot  why man they did make love to this employment  they are not near my conscience their defeat  does by their own insinuation grow  tis dangerous when the baser nature comes  between the pass and fell incensed points  of mighty opposites  why what a king is this  does it not thinkst thee stand me now upon  he that hath killd my king and whored my mother  poppd in between the election and my hopes  thrown out his angle for my proper life  and with such cozenageist not perfect conscience  to quit him with this arm and ist not to be damnd  to let this canker of our nature come  in further evil  it must be shortly known to him from england  what is the issue of the business there  it will be short the interim is mine  and a mans lifes no more than to say one  but i am very sorry good horatio  that to laertes i forgot myself  for by the image of my cause i see  the portraiture of his ill court his favours  but sure the bravery of his grief did put me  into a towering passion  peace who comes here  enter osric  your lordship is right welcome back to denmark  i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly  no my good lord  thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to  know him he hath much land and fertile let a  beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at  the kings mess tis a chough but as i say  spacious in the possession of dirt  sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i  should impart a thing to you from his majesty  i will receive it sir with all diligence of  spirit put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head  i thank your lordship it is very hot  no believe me tis very cold the wind is  northerly  it is indifferent cold my lord indeed  but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my  complexion  exceedingly my lord it is very sultryas  twerei cannot tell how but my lord his  majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a  great wager on your head sir this is the matter  i beseech you remember  hamlet moves him to put on his hat  nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith  sir here is newly come to court laertes believe  me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent  differences of very soft society and great showing  indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or  calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the  continent of what part a gentleman would see  sir his definement suffers no perdition in you  though i know to divide him inventorially would  dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw  neither in respect of his quick sail but in the  verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of  great article and his infusion of such dearth and  rareness as to make true diction of him his  semblable is his mirror and who else would trace  him his umbrage nothing more  your lordship speaks most infallibly of him  the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman  in our more rawer breath  sir  ist not possible to understand in another tongue  you will dot sir really  what imports the nomination of this gentleman  of laertes  his purse is empty already alls golden words are spent  of him sir  i know you are not ignorant  i would you did sir yet in faith if you did  it would not much approve me well sir  you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is  i dare not confess that lest i should compare with  him in excellence but to know a man well were to  know himself  i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation  laid on him by them in his meed hes unfellowed  whats his weapon  rapier and dagger  thats two of his weapons but well  the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary  horses against the which he has imponed as i take  it six french rapiers and poniards with their  assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the  carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very  responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages  and of very liberal conceit  what call you the carriages  i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done  the carriages sir are the hangers  the phrase would be more german to the matter if we  could carry cannon by our sides i would it might  be hangers till then but on six barbary horses  against six french swords their assigns and three  liberalconceited carriages thats the french bet  against the danish why is this imponed as you call it  the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes  between yourself and him he shall not exceed you  three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it  would come to immediate trial if your lordship  would vouchsafe the answer  how if i answer no  i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial  sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his  majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let  the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the  king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can  if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits  shall i redeliver you een so  to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will  i commend my duty to your lordship  yours yours  exit osric  he does well to commend it himself there are no  tongues else fors turn  this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head  he did comply with his dug before he sucked it  thus has heand many more of the same bevy that i  know the dressy age dotes ononly got the tune of  the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of  yesty collection which carries them through and  through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do  but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out  enter a lord  my lord his majesty commended him to you by young  osric who brings back to him that you attend him in  the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to  play with laertes or that you will take longer time  i am constant to my purpose they follow the kings  pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now  or whensoever provided i be so able as now  the king and queen and all are coming down  in happy time  the queen desires you to use some gentle  entertainment to laertes before you fall to play  she well instructs me  exit lord  you will lose this wager my lord  i do not think so since he went into france i  have been in continual practise i shall win at the  odds but thou wouldst not think how ill alls here  about my heart but it is no matter  nay good my lord  it is but foolery but it is such a kind of  gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman  if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will  forestall their repair hither and say you are not  fit  not a whit we defy augury theres a special  providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now  tis not to come if it be not to come it will be  now if it be not now yet it will come the  readiness is all since no man has aught of what he  leaves what ist to leave betimes  enter king claudius queen gertrude laertes lords osric and attendants with foils  and c  come hamlet come and take this hand from me  king claudius puts laertes hand into hamlets  give me your pardon sir ive done you wrong  but pardont as you are a gentleman  this presence knows  and you must needs have heard how i am punishd  with sore distraction what i have done  that might your nature honour and exception  roughly awake i here proclaim was madness  wast hamlet wrongd laertes never hamlet  if hamlet from himself be taen away  and when hes not himself does wrong laertes  then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it  who does it then his madness ift be so  hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd  his madness is poor hamlets enemy  sir in this audience  let my disclaiming from a purposed evil  free me so far in your most generous thoughts  that i have shot mine arrow oer the house  and hurt my brother  i am satisfied in nature  whose motive in this case should stir me most  to my revenge but in my terms of honour  i stand aloof and will no reconcilement  till by some elder masters of known honour  i have a voice and precedent of peace  to keep my name ungored but till that time  i do receive your offerd love like love  and will not wrong it  i embrace it freely  and will this brothers wager frankly play  give us the foils come on  come one for me  ill be your foil laertes in mine ignorance  your skill shall like a star i the darkest night  stick fiery off indeed  you mock me sir  no by this hand  give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet  you know the wager  very well my lord  your grace hath laid the odds o the weaker side  i do not fear it i have seen you both  but since he is betterd we have therefore odds  this is too heavy let me see another  this likes me well these foils have all a length  they prepare to play  ay my good lord  set me the stoops of wine upon that table  if hamlet give the first or second hit  or quit in answer of the third exchange  let all the battlements their ordnance fire  the king shall drink to hamlets better breath  and in the cup an union shall he throw  richer than that which four successive kings  in denmarks crown have worn give me the cups  and let the kettle to the trumpet speak  the trumpet to the cannoneer without  the cannons to the heavens

heaven ill havet  o good horatio what a wounded name  things standing thus unknown shall live behind me  if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart  absent thee from felicity awhile  and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain  to tell my story  march afar off and shot within  what warlike noise is this  young fortinbras with conquest come from poland  to the ambassadors of england gives  this warlike volley  o i die horatio  the potent poison quite oercrows my spirit  i cannot live to hear the news from england  but i do prophesy the election lights  on fortinbras he has my dying voice  so tell him with the occurrents more and less  which have solicited the rest is silence  dies  now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince  and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest  why does the drum come hither  march within  enter fortinbras the english ambassadors and others  where is this sight  what is it ye would see  if aught of woe or wonder cease your search  this quarry cries on havoc o proud death  what feast is toward in thine eternal cell  that thou so many princes at a shot  so bloodily hast struck  the sight is dismal  and our affairs from england come too late  the ears are senseless that should give us hearing  to tell him his commandment is fulfilld  that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead  where should we have our thanks  not from his mouth  had it the ability of life to thank you  he never gave commandment for their death  but since so jump upon this bloody question  you from the polack wars and you from england  are here arrived give order that these bodies  high on a stage be placed to the view  and let me speak to the yet unknowing world  how these things came about so shall you hear  of carnal bloody and unnatural acts  of accidental judgments casual slaughters  of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause  and in this upshot purposes mistook  falln on the inventors reads all this can i  truly deliver  let us haste to hear it  and call the noblest to the audience  for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune  i have some rights of memory in this kingdom  which now to claim my vantage doth invite me  of that i shall have also cause to speak  and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more  but let this same be presently performd  even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance  on plots and errors happen  let four captains  bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage  for he was likely had he been put on  to have proved most royally and for his passage  the soldiers music and the rites of war  speak loudly for him  take up the bodies such a sight as this  becomes the field but here shows much amiss
